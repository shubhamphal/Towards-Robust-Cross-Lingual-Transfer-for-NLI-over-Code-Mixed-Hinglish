Mujhe holiday yaad nahi. Par mujhe yeh zarur lagta ki yeh ethical tha kyuki wo ek wanted suspect tha aur wo sirf apna kaam kar rahi thi,I don't recall the holiday. I do think that it was ethical because he was a wanted suspect so she was just doing her job.

"haan, is movie mein toh nick neh uska trust aur authority nahi develop ki. aur muje guess hein ki voh criminal background mein jarur nahi aayega","Yeah, the movie didn't show Nick developing enough for him to be trusted with that kind of authority.
