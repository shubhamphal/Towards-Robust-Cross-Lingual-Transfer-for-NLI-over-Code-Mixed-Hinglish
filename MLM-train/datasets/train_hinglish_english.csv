"acha, aapse baath karne mein bahut dhanyavad. muje lagtha hein ki hamara time ab khatma ho raha hein, aapka din acha rahane ka mera subh kamna","Well, thanks for sharing this conversation with me. It seems that our time has come to an end. I hope you have a wonderful morning, afternoon, night wherever you are."
aapko bhi,You as well.
Namaste! aaj ham batman vs superman kee charcha karenge!,Hi! Today we'll be discussing Batman vs Superman!
Mahaan! kya mujhe ise dekhane se pahale kisee any dc comik movies dekhane kee jaroorat hai?,Great! Do I need to watch any other DC Comic movies prior to watching this one?
mai sach nhi keh skta halaki ye man of steel se better hai lekin dark knight jitni achi nhi hai,"I can't honestly say, however, as a critic noted ""it's better than Man of Steel but not as good as The Dark Knight"". "
lead actors kon hai>,Who are the lead actors? 
ye 2013 ki man of steel ko follow krti hai so safely dekhna,It follows 2013's Man of Steel so you would probably need to see it just to be safe...
"Batman, Superman aur wonder woman bhi hai isme","Batman, Superman and even wonder woman makes an appearance!"
"Haha kya aap jante ho ki is film mai konse actor Batman, Superman, aur Wonder Womanrole ker rhe hai?","Haha! Do you know which actors play Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman in this movie? "
"Ben Affleck Batmanka Bruce Wayne, Henry Cavill Clark Kent Superman ka role paly ker rhe hai. Gal Gadot film mai Diane Lane Martha Kent ka aur Amy Adams Louis Lane ka role play ker rhe hai. kya tum in actors ke fan ho","Ben Affleck plays Batman/Bruce Wayne, Henry Cavill plays Clark Kent/Superman. Gal Gadot stars in the film as well as Diane Lane as Martha Kent and Amy Adams as Louis Lane. Are you a fan of any of those actors?"
sabhi lekin Ben Affleck ki last super hero movie main usse Daredevils mai dekh tha wo mote tha hoskta hai isme kuch acha kam hoga,All but Ben Affleck. Lest super hero movie I saw him in was Daredevil and that was rough. Let's hope he's better in this. 
halaki me batman mai Michael Keaton ka fan hu muje lgta hai ki koi or batman ka paly nhi ker payge jo michel keaton ne kiya,"Though, I am a Michael Keaton fan when it comes to Batman. I suspect anyone playing Batman who is not Keaton will be weird to me. "
bhote se critics ko ye pasand nhi tha par cinemascore mai rating B thi muje lgta hai ye sahi thi,"Most of the critics wasn't too fond of it, but CinemaScore have it a rating of B, which I feel is about right for this film!"
kya tumne dekhi hai,Have you seen it?
"Maine is solid B grade karta, jaise k CinemaScore ne kiya. Kya tum director Zack Snyder k fan ho?","I have and would grade it a solid B, just as CinemaScore did. Are you a fan of director Zack Snyder?"
"Main sure nahi hu, usne aur kaunsi movies direct ki hai?",I'm not sure. What other movies has he directed? 
Usne Batman V Superman direct ki hai. Wo movie General Zod aur Superman k battle k 18 month baad hoti hai. Superman ek controversial figure ban jata hai aur Clark Kent ko Batman k Justice k tareeke k baare me pata chalta hai aur wo use Daily Planet k articles me expose karna chahta hai,He directed Batman vs Superman. The film takes place 18 months after the battle between General Zod and Superman. Superman becomes a controversial figure while Clark Kent learns of Batman's form of justice and seeks to expose him via Daily Planet articles. 
Kya usne Batman aur Superman movie k alawa kuch direct kiya hai?,Has he directed anything else besides the Batman or Superman movies?
"Honestly, main bol nahi sakta hai. Mujhe pata hai k usne ye film direct ki hai aur David S. Goyer aur Chris Terrio ne write ki hai",I can't honestly say. I know he directed this film while David S. Goyer and Chris Terrio cowrote it. 
Kya Batman aur Superman is film me enemies hai?,Batman and Superman are enemies in this film? 
"Wo hai. Lex Luthor jo Superman ko harane ko lekar obsessed hai , basically dono ko ek dusre ko fight karne me manipulate kar deta hai.","They are - Lex Luthor, who is obsessed with defeating Superman, basically manipulates them into fighting each other."
Wonder Woman kis side pe rahti hai.,Whose side is Wonder Woman on?
"Well to be honest, Batman Superman ko hara deta hai aur jaise hi wo Superman ko maarne wala rahta hai, Superman bolta hai ""save martha"" to Lane andar aati hai aur explain karti hai k Martha uski maa hai. Batman Martha ko rescue karta hai aur Superman scout ship pe Luthor ko confront karta hai. Is point pe Wonder Woman ab tak debut nahi ki hai","Well to be honest, Batman has Superman beat and just before he can kill Superman, Superman utters ""save martha"" to which Lane enterenters and explains Martha is his mother. Batman rescues Martha while Superman confronts Luther on the scout ship. At this point, Wonder Woman hasn't debuted yet "
Dang! Crazy Batman superman ko hara deta hai. Kya wo bas ek millionaire nahi juske pas bhut fancy gadget hai. Superman k paas at least real super powers hai. Koi bhi sochega k wo superman jeetega. Kya Batman k paas kryptonite ya kuch tha?,"Dang! Crazy that Batman has Superman beat! Isn't Batman just a millionaire with a lot of fancy gadgets? Superman at least has real super powers. You would think that would give him a one-up. Did Batman have kryptonite
 or something?"
"main aapase bahut sahamat hoon! yah hairaan karane vaala hai, lekin baitamain ke paas ek bhaala hai, jisase vah suparamain ko maarane kee yojana banaata hai, isase pahale ki vah ""sev maartha"" lain ka upayog karata hai, baitamain ko maarane se rok deta hai.","I do very much agree with you! It is puzzling but Batman has a spear he plans to kill superman with just before he utters the ""Save Martha"" line, halting Batman from killing him."
kya usake baad sena mein shaamil hote hain?,Do the join forces after that?
वे*,they*
"ve shukr manaate hain - baitamain vaastav mein maartha ko bachaata hai, jabaki suparamain ka saamana loothar ke saath skaut jahaaj tak jaata hai.",They do thankfully - Batman actually saves Martha while Superman travels to the scout ship to Confront Luther.
kya vah ko Luther maarata hai?,Does he kill Luther? 
"Luther bhee vahee tha jisane maartha ka apaharan kiya tha. vah loothar ko nahin maarata hai, lekin loothar ko giraphtaar kar liya jaata hai, jisamen baitamain ne jel mein rahane ke dauraan usaka saamana kiya, chetaavanee dee ki vah hamesha dekhata rahega","Luther was also the one who kidnapped Martha. He doesn't kill Luther but Luther is arrested to which Batman confronts him while he's in prison, warning that he'll always be watching."
to mool roop se phrainchaizee mein ek aur philm ke lie ek opaning chhod raha hoon?,So basically leaving an opening for another movie in the franchise?
mainne is philm mein suparamain aur baitamain ke aautaphit par bahas sunee hai. kuchh ka kahana hai ki ve kamaal ke hain aur kuchh kahate hain ki ve haasyaaspad hain aur bahut alag roop mein unake b ailovaid mool hain. is par aapake vichaar kya hain?,"I've heard debates on Superman's and Batman's outfits in this movie. Some say that they are awesome and some say that they are ridiculous and too different form their b
eloved originals. What are your thoughts on this?"
"ve karate hain ... aphasos kee baat hai ki, suparamain kee mrtyu ho jaatee hai, haalaanki, broos ven ne metaahumans kee ek teem banaane ka iraada kiya, metahumans ke saath shuroo karate hue unhonne lyoopor kee phailon mein sooparamain kee anupasthiti mein duniya kee raksha karane ke lie paaya","They do... Sadly, Superman dies, however, Bruce Wayne intends to form a team of Metahumans, starting with the Metahumans he found in Luthor's files to protect the world in Sueprmans absence. "
"jabaki yah aisa lagata tha jaise ek bade aadamee ka do minat mein ek saath do gudiyon ko pakadana, mujhe abhee bhee main oph steel se behatar laga.","While it did seem like 153 minutes of a grown man whacking two dolls together, I still found it better than Man of Steel."
"rukoo, superman maar gaya ? keise??","Wait, Superman dies? How??"
bahut Imandaari se film ke aakhir mei  dirt superman kocoffin mei rakh deta hai ! socho ki ham aakhari line mei hai! hamare saath batman or superman ke bare mei baat karne ko maja le. mei aapko ek din isko dekhane ki salah deta hu.  yadi aap sahmat hai to filma ka score B hai mere khayal de aap pasand karoge  aap apna khayal rakhe or aapka din achcha ho!,"Well to be honest, at the end of the film, the dirt atop Sueprman's coffin does begin to levitate! I think we're at the finish line! I enjoyed chatting with you about Batman vs Superman! I highly recommend you seeing it one day. If you agree with CinemaScore, they rated it a B so I think you'll enjoy it and encourage you to watch it! Take care and have a great day!"

aur mein iska director ke baare mein bhi kuch suna nahi haei,and i havent heard about that director
muje lagtha ki yeh uska first movie hei,i wonder if this is the first movie he made
haan kuch familiar sounds karta,he actually sounds familiar
probably kuch samay lagega is tarah ka movies ko direct karna,it probably takes a lot to direct a movie like this
i think tum sahi ho,i think u are right
par uska metacritic score 56/100 tha.,but its metacritic score was 56/100. ow
bahut kam,really low
"jahaan se meine suna hai, angelina jolie ne bahut achcha perform kiya hain usme.",from what i hear angelina jolie performed really well in it
well mujhe pyaar karta hoon usse,well i love her
main ek ladki hoon,im a girl

par critical responses,but the critical responses
"ye interesting hai ki, frozen ki tarah, true love scenario    ke liye prince ki zarurat nahi thi","it is interesting that, like frozen, a prince was not needed for the true love scenario"
ye ek mother daughter love ki tarah tha,it was like a mother daughter love
or mujhe wo pasand hai,and i love that
Jo mujhe sach mein pasand hai,which i really like

philm joz par aapakee kya raay hai?,What is your opinion on the movie Jaws? 
"sach kahoon, to mujhe shaark philmen bhayaanak lagatee hain.","To be honest, I find shark movies to be terrifying."
main yah nahin kah sakata ki main tumhen dosh deta hoon. philm nishchit roop se us dar ko badatar bana detee hai!,I can't say I blame you. The movie definitely makes that fear worse! 
Kya tumhe pata hai ki ye film ek book par based hai.,Did you know that this film was based on a book?
"Nahi , maine nahi. Lekin mein surprise nahi hun zyadatar movies mein aisa hi hota hai.","No, I didn't. Not surprised though. Most movies tend to be. "
Lekin Jaws ka music mujhe pasand hai.,I do love the Jaws music though. 
"Agreed, ye tension ko badhata hai aur isko aur daravana banata hai, lekin shayad uska wahi point hai.","Agreed, it heightens the tension and makes it scarier, but that's kind of the point."
Kya aap surprised hain ki is film ki critic score rating itni high hai ? Aur agar mein iska music driving karte samay sunoon to mujhe lagega ki koi mujhe maarne aa raha hai. Haha,"Are you surprised at how high the rating is for the film's critic score? And if I heard the music while driving, I would think someone was coming to take me out. Haha"
"97% bahut zyada high hai , mujhe laga ki kam se kam kuch log to low scores denge.","97% is incredibly high, I would have thought that there would be at least some people throwing low scores in there somewhere."
"Kya aap sehmat hai ki ye ""cheerfully perverse"" daravani movie hai ?","Do you agree that it's a ""cheerfully perverse"" scare movie?"
"Mujhe bhi aisa hi lagta hai. Shayad isliye kyunki us zamane mein aisa pehle nahi hua tha aur jo nikal ke aaya wo kafi alag tha ? Usko """"give it a pass"" dena easier hoga aur mein kahunga ki ye ""cheerfully perverse"" depending on aap kaisi movies pasand karte hain.","That's what I thought as well. Maybe it's because it was never done before in it's time and was so different when it came out? It might be easier to ""give it a pass"" 

And I would say it could be ""cheerfully perverse"" depending on the kind of movies you enjoy. "
"Kya aapko lagta hai ki it ""is too gruesome for children""?","Do you think that it ""is too gruesome for children""? "
"Chhote bacchon ke liye haan, unko nightmares aa sakte hain.","For small children, yes. I could see them having nightmares."
"main definitely isase agree karta hoon. Mujhe yah ajeeb lagata hai ki ise ek ""Thriller"" film maana jaata hai.","I definitely agree with that. I do find it odd that it is considered a ""Thriller"" film. "
mujhe lagata hai ki yah interesting hai ki key scenes mein yah  shark attacks ke ek beach town pareconomic impact ka baare main batata hai. Aapako aashchary hota hai ki kya ve real life mein adhik paisa banaane ke lie aisa kuchh cover karenge.,I think it's interesting that in the key scenes it describes the economic impact on a beach town of the shark attacks. Makes you wonder if they'd cover something like that up to make more money in real life.
"aaj ke society mein, mujhe lagata hai ki aisa hee hoga. yahaan tak ​​ki agar ek bounty hunter ko kaam par rakha gaya tha, to ve shaayad bolengain, ""yahaan dekhane ke lie kuchh bhee nahin hai, maze karo!""","In today's society, I think that would absolutely be the case. Even if there was a bounty hunter hired, they would probably go, ""Nothing to see here, have fun!"" "
"mujhe yah interesting lagata hai ki unhonne ise fictional  ""New England resort town"" mein rakha tha. Aapako lagata hai ki ve Californiamein kaheen aur le gae hote kyonki vahaan bahut saare beaches hain aur yah kitana vishaal hai.","I find it interesting that they put it in a fictional ""New England resort town"". You would think they would've picked somewhere in California since there's so many beaches and how huge it is. "
"Main ye maanta hoon ki , aamataur par  New England mein bahut saare shark attacks nahin hote hain, aamataur par south mein ya west coast par.","Agreed, there typically aren't many shark attacks in New England, usually further south or on the west coast."
"main imagine nahin kar sakata ki main ek tourist ke roop mein  beacht par jata rahoongan , agar bahut saare log marate hue paaye jate rahein.",I can't imagine I would keep going to the beach as a tourist if lots of people kept turning up dead.
"Main agree karta hoon. Movie ek tarah se silly hai , jitana bhi aap isake baare mein sochate hain. khaasakar jab log shahar aur beach team par vishvaas karate rahate ki sab kuchh theek hai.phir bhee log marate rahate hain? mujhe lagata hai ki ve chaahate hain ki aap disbelief ko suspend karen. hah।",I agree. The movie is kind of silly the more you think about it. Especially when people keep believing the town and beach team that everything is fine. Yet people keep dying? I guess they want you to suspend disbelief. Haha. 
ya aapako lagata hai ki tourists paisa banaane ke lie bounty mein shaamil honge.,Or you would think that tourists would join in on the bounty to make the money. 
mujhe pata nahin tha ki kinaare ke paas itane saare different type ke sharks the.,I wasn't aware that there were so many different types of sharks so near to the shore. 
"key scenes main tiger shark aur ek great white, donon ka varnan kiya gaya hai.",The key scens describes both a tiger shark and a great white.
Main soch raha tha ki mayor sheher mein kahin paise leta hai ya beach ke khulne pe? Woh beach kholne par bohot adamant tha. Aur mujhe humesha lagta tha ki Tiger Sharks chotti hoti hain.,"I wonder if the mayor is paid off somewhere in the town or gets a cut of the beaches being open? He's far to adamant about keeping them open. 

And I always thought Tiger Sharks were smaller. "
"Maine Great Whites ko humesha unn badi ""Jaws"" sharks ki tarah socha hai.","I always think of Great White's as the huge ""Jaws"" sharks. "
Ajeeb hai ki woh kissi scientist ya marine biologist ko beech mein nahi laa rahe.,It seems odd that they don't ask a scientist or marine biologist at some point to intervene.
Last scene mein bhi bohot hi limited plan hai shark ko hook ya harpoon karne ka.,Even the last key scene describes a pretty limited plan to hook the shark or harpoon it.
"Sahi, I agree. Unke paas shark attack determine karne ke liye ek ""Oceanographer"" hai. Par koi scientists nahi laaye help karne ke liye.","I agree. They have an ""Oceanographer"" to help determine a shark attack. But no scientists ever get brought in to help the situation. "
"Kaafi bekar plan hai, aur aage jaate jaate woh plan banaate jaa rahe hain.","It seems like a pretty poor plan, and they end up having to make it up as they go along. "
"Kitna crazy hai ki shark ne ""shark-proof"" cage todd diya.","It seems crazy that a shark could take out a ""Shark-proof"" cage. "
"Aur, $10,000 ka reward bohot kam hai life risk karne ke liye.","Plus, the reward of only $10,000 seems pretty low to risk lives."
Shayad 1975 mein isse zyaada worth tha.,Maybe it was worth a lot more in 1975?
"Haan. Mere liye toh worth nahi hai. Shark ko chhod ke, main NYC vacation par chala jaoonga. Haha.",I agree. Not worth it to me. I'll go on vacation in NYC instead and avoid the shark. Haha. 
Aur yeh 1975 Definitely adhik kimat ka hoga.me nahi janti how much.,And it was definitely worth more in 1975. I just don't know how much.

One of the twists in the plot is that a Russian spy is discovered by Turing.  Which isn't surprising at first, but then we find out that British intelligence planted him to tell the Russians secrets they wanted them to know, after all Russia and Great Britain were on the same side in WWII."
"yah raajaneetik sthiti ke ek mod kee tarah hai, lekin jo kuchh bhee, supar upayogee ya dilachasp hai, (yah ek mahaan philm kee tarah lagata hai)?","That's sort of a twisted narrative of the political situation, but whatever, anything else super useful or interesting, (it sounds like a great movie)?"
"jab mainne philm dekhee, to mujhe unake paas kodabreking masheen pasand aaee, yah is vishaal takaneekee dikhane vaalee deevaar thee jo wwii ke samay se pahale thee. haan, saajish mein ek aur mod hai jahaan roosee jaasoos ne sabhee ko yah bataane kee dhamakee dee ki tyooring samalaingik hai.","When I watched the movie, I liked the codebreaking machine they had,  It was this massive technical looking wall that was way before the time of WWII.  Yes, there's another twist in the plot where the Russian spy threatens to tell everyone that Turing is homosexual."
jaasoos ko kaise pata chala ki tyooring samalaingik tha?,How did the spy know that Turing was gay?
"tyooring ne jaasoos ko bataaya, kyonki tyooring kee shaadee klaark (naitalee) se hone vaalee thee. yah mujhe uchch naatak kee tarah lagata hai. jaasoos (tyooring se pahale ehasaas hua ki vah ek jaasoos tha) ne tyooring ko apanee samalaingikata ko gupt rakhane ke lie kaha tha. mujhe lagata hai ki ve bahut tang the.","Turing told the spy, because Turing was about to get married to Clarke (Knightley).  It sounds like high drama to me.  The spy (before Turing realized he was a spy) told Turing to keep his homosexuality a secret.  I guess they were pretty tight."
"vaah, yah us samay kee avadhi ke lie ek badee raajabhaasha gopaneeyata kee gend hai, kya saajish ke baare mein kuchh aur hai ya jo kuchh bhee aapako mujhe bataana chaahie?","Wow, that's a big ol' ball of secrecy for that time period, is there anything else about the plot or whatever you should tell me?"
"haan, philm ke ant mein, mitr raashtr yuddh jeetata hai aur bos kriptograaphars ko ek doosare ko phir kabhee nahin dekhane ka vaada karata hai aur ve sabhee kod ko nasht kar dete hain. isake alaava, tyooring klaark (naitalee) ko chhodane ke lie kahata hai kyonki vah usakee suraksha ke lie darata hai. vah usase kahata hai ki vah samalaingik hai aur usane kabhee usakee paravaah nahin kee, jo sach nahin tha kyonki vah usake saath pyaar mein thee.","Yes, at the end of the movie, the Allies win the war and the boss makes the cryptographers promise to never see each other again and they destroy all the code.  Also, Turing tells Clarke (Knightley) to leave because he is scared for her safety.  He tells her he is gay and that he never cared for her, which wasn't true because he was in love with her."
roten tomaatoz par ise bahut achchha skor mila.,It got a pretty good score on Rotten Tomatoes.
sada hua tamaatar skor kya hai?,What's the rotten tomatoes score?
"roten tomaatoz 91% hai, sinemaaskor e + hai, aur metaakritik skor 73/100 par thoda kam hai.","Rotten Tomatoes is 91%, CinemaScore is A+, and Metacritic Score is a bit low at 73/100."
"hamm, bilkul bhee bura nahin hai, yah kahata hai ki yah kab jaaree kiya gaya tha?","Hmm, not bad at all, does it say when it was released?"
mujhe lagata hai ki is philm ke baare mein kya aapako lagata hai ki aap ise dekhenge?,"I think that about does it for this movie, do you think you'll see it?"
2014 mein,in 2014
"yah vaastav mein achchha lagata hai, adhik sambhaavana nahin hai, main karoonga; aap kaise hain?","It sounds really good, more likely than not, I will; how about you?"
I didn't realize I had already seen it until I started reading this. I remember it was really good. If a movie isn't good I usually don't recall it this clearly.,I didn't realize I had already seen it until I started reading this.  I remember it was really good.  If a movie isn't good I usually don't recall it this clearly.
"us bhayaanak yuddh ke dauraan jeevan kaisa tha, yah nishchit roop se achchha tha. yah aapake saath achchhee chaiting hai, mujhe maza aaya.","It was definitely a good look into what life was like during that horrible war.  It's been good chatting with you, I enjoyed."
"yogy, isee tarah, mujhe poora yakeen hai ki ham sirph is bindu par baahar nikalane ka sarvekshan karenge aur unhen bataenge ki kya ham philm dekhana chaahate hain, hai na?","Lol, likewise, I'm pretty sure we just do the exit survey at this point and tell them whether we want to see the movie, right? "

"han, mein aapse sehmat hu - mein ye maanta hu ki humko emma stone aur ryan gosling ko kuch slack kaatna chahiye kyuki wo singers nahi hain","yep, i agree with you - i do believe we have to cut emma stone and ryan gosling some slack, since they're not singers"
"Han, meine mana. Mujhe wah scene bohat achha laga jahan Sebastian jazz music improv karta hai jabki usko sirf Christmas music play karna chahiye.",Agreed. I really liked the scene where Sebastian improvs jazz music when he is supposed to be playing Christmas music only. 
Ye unmein se ek scene tha jo film dekhne k baad bhi mere sath chipka reh gaya.,It was one of those scenes that really stuck with me after I watched the movie
"tum kya karte, agar tum uski position mein hote?","would you do that, if you were in his position?"
Mujhe sure nahi hu. Mujhe yah pasand aaya ki jab Mia ne pehli baar Sebastian ko gaate huye suna aur wo sach mein uss se move ho gayi. Mujhe lagta hai ye unki relationship ko start karne a interesting way tha.,I'm not sure. I liked how that was when Mia first heard Sebastian sing and was truly moved by it. I think it was interesting way to initiate their relationship
"han, ye sad tha ki usne usko brush off kar dia, warna baatein kuch alag hi hoti","yeah, it was just sad how he brushed her off, since things could've been different"
Mujhe ye achha laga ki jab next time Mia ne Sebastian ko dekha wo bhi gana ga raha hai.  Mujhe ye bhi pasand aaya ki usne usko ek aisa gana request karke chidhaya kyuki usko pata tha ki usko wo gana gana achha nahi lagega,I do like how the next time Mia sees Sebastian he is also singing. I also liked how she kind of teased him by requesting a song she knew he would hate to sing
Tum usually musicals dekhte ho?,do you usually watch musicals?
"kabhi kabhi.  Mujhe bhi Sebastian aur Mia ki relationship ka development achha laga, jaise jab Mia decide karti hai ki ab wo akele hi play karegi kyuki Sebastian ne usko aisa suggest kia. Mujhe laga ki wo dono bohat grow karte hain as individuals jab wo relationship mein aa jate hain","Occasionally. I also enjoyed the development of Sebastian and Mia's relationship, such as when Mia decides to begin writing a play all by herself because Sebastian suggests it to her. I feel like the two of them really grow as individuals when they get into a relationship"
"maine woh part bhi enjoy kiya, kyon ki yeh dikhata hai kitna hard ye donon kaam kar rahen hain apne dreams achieve karne ke liye","I enjoyed that part too, since it also shows how hard both of them are working to achieve their dreams"
"donon chahte hain ki successful banen apne seperate ares mein, lekin bahut struggle karna padega","they both want to become successful in their separate areas, but they have to struggle a lot"
Right. lagta hai review jo cruelty ko mention karta hai dreams ko follow karten hai sum karta hai.film afraid nahin karta hai ki kitna hard work aur hardship involve karta hai bada hasil karne ke liye,Right. I feel like the review that mentions the cruelty that's involved in following your dreams really sums it up. The film is not afraid to show how much hard work and hardship is involved in making it big
mujhe bhi laga ki sebastian keo keith ka offer difficult laga,i also thought it was difficult for sebastian to take keith's offer
"mera matlab hai, use payment milta hai lekin woh hai nahin karna chahta hai.  ye bahut hota hai life mein","i mean, he gets paid, but it's not something he wants to do. This happens in life a lot"
main agree karta hoon. hard lagta hoga kuch karne kojab tum passionate nahin hoge- especially jab tumhe kuch karna hoga tumhe ek din live karna hai dreams ke liye,I agree. It must be hard to do something you're not passionate about- especially when it's something you must do in order to one day live out your dreams
kya laga tumhe woh scene jab Mia or Sebastian fight karne lage jo Mia soch rahi thi Sebastian drams ko chod raha hai?,What did you think of the scene when Mia and Sebastian get into a fight about Mia thinking Sebastian is giving up on his dreams?
"usme ekdum acchi acting thi, lekin sympathize karta hoon donon se","it was definitely well acted, and i sympathize with both of them"
mujhe lagta hai sebastian harsh tha jab usne mia se kaha ki woh use aur pasand karta tha jab woh unsucessful tha,but i think sebastian was harsh when he said that mia liked him more when he was unsuccessful
truly woh heartbreaking thi jab Mia vapas Nevada ghar mein gayi,It truly was heartbreaking when Mia moved back home to Nevada
"muje lagtha hein ki voh sach jaan ne mein hiskis hein, kyon ki voh apna dream ko give up karta hein","i feel he didn't want to hear the truth, because he was really giving up on his dreams"
voh toh bura huva,it really was sad
mein maantha hoon. voh toh unpredictable plot twist tha. muje toh patha hi nahi chala ki voh aap raha hein,I agree. It was also a very unpredictable plot twist. I did not see it coming at all
kya tuje aisa laga ki voh low point ka movie hein?,would you say that was the low point in the movie?
"haan, lakin  muje lag raha hai ki koi sagged badly ko review karega","Yes but I wouldn't say any part of the movie ""sagged badly"" as one review claims"
"haan maantha hoon, overall mein toh apni friend ko is movie ko recommend karunga","i agree - overall, i would recommend the movie to a friend"
"mein bhi. toh dusra review point mein toh voh ""genuinely romantic comedy"" bola tha , jo mein completely agree karunga kyon ki muje lagtha hei ki Sebastian aur Mia ka relationship toh cliche nahi hein jo love stories mein huva hota hein. lakin voh relationship toh mein realness se appreciate karunga","I agree. As another review points out it was a ""genuinely romantic comedy"", which I completely agree with because I feel as though Sebastian and Mia's relationship was not as cliche as many love stories are in movies. I appreciated the realness of their relationship"
"haan, yehi toh muje is movie se pasand aaya- voh toh sad tha lakin cliche ending bana","yes, that was one thing i loved about the movie - while it was sad, it was not a cliche ending"
mein maantha hoon. muje lagtha ki Damien Chazelle ne is film ko ache directing ki,I agree. I think Damien Chazelle really did a good job directing the film. 
"mein toh curious hoon, aap?","i'm curious, are you an ai"
"agar aisa hai, to mujhe poori tarah se fool bnaya gaya","if so, i was completely fooled"
main nahi hu,I am not! 
"lakin main bilkul surprise hu ki kisi ne Sebastian ko as a ""jazz snob "" reviewed kiya kyun ki mujhe wo vibe bilkul bhi nahi mili","But I really was surprised that someone reviewed Sebastian as a ""jazz snob"" because I did not get that vibe at all"
"haan, main disagree hu us characterization ke stah, lakin main dekh saktu hu kyun kuch log aisa keh sakte hai","yeah, i disagreed with that characterization, but i can see why someone might say that."
"wo ek purist hai, ya phir jo kuch bhi unhone use film main bulaya","he is a purist, or whatever they called it in the film"
"mujuhe bhi aisa nahi lagta ki Mia ka character depth main lack karta hai. Mujhe lagta hai balki wo round character thi, especially usne  large amount of independence ke sath usne possessed kiya. Use bahut zada courage lagi hogi wapas Neveda ke main wapas jane ke liye","I also really didn't think Mia's character lacked depth. I think she was a rather round character, especially with the large amount of independence she possessed. It took a lot of courage for her to move back to Nevada"
"hann, mujhe lagta hai ki uska character pretty nuanced tha, lakin main sure nahi hu ki ye uke liye courageous hai wapas Nevada move hona. play ke sahi na jane ke baad, mujhe lagta hai uske paas keval yahi option tha.","yes, i thought her character was pretty nuanced, but i'm not sure it being courageous of her to move back to Nevada. After the play didn't go well, I think that was her only option"
iske bare main,*about it
mujhe lagta hai ki apke paas pont hai. Mian sochta hu ki wo zada independent thi average woman se jaisa ki film main portray kiya gaya kyunki jab chieze uske liye work out nahi ki wo Sebastian ke upar chipki nahi,I suppose you have a point. I just think she was more independent of the average woman portrayed in films as she didn't cling on to Sebastian when things didn't work out for her. 
halaki main wish karta hu ki vain apne dreams ko achieve karne se pehle reconcile kare,although I wish they reconciled before achieving their dreams
end me jo dikhaya ki actually me kya ban sakta hai usse maine kafi sad feel kiya,the bit at the end that showed what could have been actually made me sad
I agree! Yah bahut sad tha but also ek reviewer ne jaise bataya ki yah quite bittersweet ha. Mai sure hi nahi tha ki ant me mai kya feel karu.,"I agree! It was very sad but also, as one reviewer puts it quite ""bittersweet."" I wasn't sure how to feel at the end. "

But teen comedy film me itna to expected hi hai.,But that's to be expected in a teen comedy film.

"Mark Zuckerburg ne Facebook kaise start kiya movie is baare me hai, iska naam hai ""The Social Network"". Dekhne me bahut interesting hai kyonki ye real events pe based hai.","This movie is about how Facebook got started by Mark Zuckerberg, it's called ""The Social Network"". Interesting to watch because it's based on real events."
maine is movie ke baare me pahle bhi suna hai,I have heard of that movie before
Although maine pahle dekhi nahi hai,Although I haven't watched it before
"Yah jis kitab par yah aadharit hai usse bhi jyada popular hai, The Accidental Billionaires, probably because ye kahani hai Sex, Money aur dhokhe ki, wo stuff jiske sath ham sab identify karte hai.","It was more popular than the book it was based on, The Accidental Billionaires, probably because it's a tale of Sex, Money, and Betrayal. Stuff we can all identify with"
oh yah to really interesting hai,Oh that is really interesting
yah to pahle se jyada intriguing sound kar raha hai,It makes it sound more intriguing than before
kya aapne dekhi hai,Have you seen it
"yes, ham sabne Facebook ke bare me suna hai, but ye shuru kaise hua uski story kafi surprising hai. movie me jo dekha us sab par believe to nahi hua, par mera interest isme bana raha","Yes, we've all heard of Facebook, but the story of how it got started is pretty surprising. I didn't believe everything I saw in the movie, but it held my interest"
I think sometime ye movie me kuch information sirf ise interesting aur audience ko entertained rakhne ke liye karte hai.,I think sometimes they add information to movies just to keep the audience entertained
Ye understandable hai because koi bhi boring movie nahi chahta.,Which is understandable because you don't want a boring movie 
mujhe bilkul idea nahi tha ke wo book hai,I had no idea it was a book thogh
"beshak ye drama hai. Zuckerberg  aur current staff ka koi involvement nahi tha movie banane ,isme kuch dark irony hai lekin ek founder,Eduardo Saverin ne book ke author se mulaqat ki","No doubt, It is a drama. Zuckerberg and the current staff weren't involved in making the movie, it has a kind of dark irony, but one of the founders, Eduardo Saverin, was consulted by the book's author. "
mujhe yaqeen hai kuch information  hai jo wo log movie ya book mein leak nahi karna chahte,I am sure there is information that they didn't want to leak in the movie and even the book
toh kya aap ye movie dekhna recommend karte hai? ye kuch saal puraani hai agar aur zyada puranni nahi hai toh,So would you recommend seeing this movie? It a couple of years old if not older. 
"haan, ye engaging look hai us waqt mein jub websites bus shuru ho rahe thay. kuch lawsuits  jo jub shuruat mein nikle thay shayad bhi bhi chal rahe hai","Yes, it's an engaging look at that time period when websites were just getting started. Some of the lawsuits that came out of those beginnings might still be on going. "
mujhe yaqeen hai. mujhe yaad hai  maine padha tha jub lawsuits file hue thay. mere khayal se unke pass khud ko bachanay ache lawyers hai,I believe it. I remember reading about the lawsuits when they were filed. I think they have great lawyers to protect themselves though...
film shuru hoti hai 2003 mein jub Zuckerberg  19 saal ka student  tha Harvard mein. usne asal Facemash naam ki campus website banayi jisme users female students ke photos ke attractiveness  ko rate kar sakte thay,The film starts in 2003 when Zuckerberg was a 19 year old student at Harvard. He actually created a campus website called Facemash that allowed users to rate the attractiveness of photos of female students.
ye puray taur par bahut acha description  hai unlog ke liye jinko movie ka synapse  chahiye,"That is a really good overall description for someone who wants a synapse
 of the movie. "
"Oh,wo toh bus shuruat hai. wo website itni popular hai ke isko Winklevoss twins ka attention mila,jo  upper class men thay jinho ne Harvard ke liye exclusive  dating website banayi","Oh, that's just the beginning. That website was so popular it got the attention of the Winklevoss twins, who were upper class men who made a dating website exclusive to Harvard.  So the origins of the idea for the site are kind of vague
 "
kya company kuch patent ya legal documents ki hifazat me hai,Is the company protected by a patent or some kind of legal documents?
"Main nahi jaanta, par Zukerbreg ko college database ko hack karne aur harward computer network ko crash karne ke liye 6 months ka academic probation mila tha. So wo is baat se aware hoge ki rogue programmer kis prakar ka damage kar sakte hai.","I don't know, but Zuckerberg was given 6 months academic probation for hacking into college databases and crashing the Harvard computer network. So he's aware of what kind of damage a rogue programmer can do."
As a programmer me ye dekh sakta hun ki databases aur networks me hacking se jo nuksaan ho sakta hai.,As a programmer I could see the damage that can be done by hacking into databases and networks.
damage is situation me hone ke liye bounded tha.,damage was bound to happen in this situation
"So tum bhi ye jaante ho ki business ko smart translate karne ke liye programming ka knowledge necessary nahi hai. Ye jab zukerberg ne Napster ke co-founder sean parker se hooked up kiya, is se business really me take off karna start karta hai.",So you also know that programming knowledge doesn't necessarily translate to business smarts. It's when Zuckerberg gets hooked up with Napster co-founder Sean Parker that the business really starts to take off
Me Npaster ko use karne ke baare me totally bhool gaya tha. Me use hamesa use karne ka aadi hun. Mujhe koi idea nahi ki wo iska co-founder hai,"I had totally forgotten about using Napster. I use to always use it. Had no idea he co-f
ounded it."
"Facebook ke pehle bhi other social networks the, jo ki zuckerberg ne kaha tha jab wo site ko yale, columbia aur stanford me expand kar rahe the. Mujhe Nepster bhi pasand hai, aur mera Myspace ka account bhi hai. But ye sab badal gaya jab parker ne suggest kiya facebook to palo alto.","There were other social networks before The Facebook, too, which is what Zuckerberg called it while expanding the site to Yale, Columbia, and Stanford. I liked Napster, too, and had a MySpace account.  But that all changed after Parker suggested they drop 'The' and move Facebook to Palo Alto. "
Mere pass bhi Myspace account hai par maine kabhi hi 2 years me logged in kiya.,"I I also had a MySpace account but haven't logged in roughly
 2 years. "
"Mere liye thodi der ho gayi. Paker ne zuckerberg ke saath house sharing khatm kar di Palo alto me, apne partner saverin ko new york me hi business development ka kaam karne ke liye chhod diya. Meanwhile wo california me billion dollar ki company  ke business plan ko develop karne lage.","Been a while for me, too.  Parker ended up sharing a house in Palo Alto with Zuckerberg, leaving his partner Saverin in New York to work on ""Business Development"". Meanwhile they were developing plans for the business in California to make a billion dollar company. "
Ye crazy tha. Unke pass company ko million dollar ki company banane ka potential hai jo ki mind blowing hai.,That is crazy. To have potentially in a company to make a billion dollar company is mind blowing
"Well, Saverin aur Winklevoss judwa ne apan interests company me rakhne ka try kiya. Film me un scenes ko intercut kar diya jisme Zuckerberg ke against deposition case the. Unhone eventually court ke bahar hi settle kar liya, zukerberg ke defense sochte hai ki wo jury ko unsympathetic appear hoge.","Well, Saverin and the Winklevoss twins tried to keep their interests in the company. The film is intercut with scenes from their depositions in the cases against Zuckerberg. They eventually settled out of court because Zuckerberg's defense thinks he will appear unsympathetic to a jury."
"tho, agar voh unsympathetic ke liye nahi jaayega tho defense he uska best choice rehega","Well if he wasn't going to seem unsympathetic
 than maybe it was the best choice for the defense "
"no doubt, film mein tho kahi sordid details hein us founding aur callous ka attitude ke baare mein, zuckerberg tho us collaborators ke sa saath hein.. lekin end mein, jab usne usko friend ko request diya tho thoda weird feel huva","No doubt, the film has lots of sordid details about the founding and the callous attitude Zuckerberg had towards his collaborators. But the end, when he's sending a friend request, is when it get's really weird. "
"ugh, mein end hate kartha kyon ki voh cliff hangers ko nahi choda aur end mein kuch explanation bhi nahi diya us future events ko",Ugh I hate endings that either leave cliff hangers or just ends with no explanation of the future events
"mein sun liya.. ending tho world he deal karna chahiye, lekin superman absent they aur sabhi yek ke piche chod rahe the, clarks ka coffins upper se dirt ud raha tha hava mein. kaise huva yeh sab","I hear you. This ending has to deal with a world where Superman is absent, and after every one leaves, the dirt on top of Clark's coffin starts rising into the air. How about that!"

It also most likely made him realize he didn't belong with the criminals especially after they were making sexual comments about the same person who was taking care of him"
ISSE KARAN US NE SOCH LIYA KI ZINDAHGI USKE LIYE NAHIN HAIN. AGAR KOI AISI BAAT KISI KE BARE ME JISE TUM PYAAR KARTHE HO  TO TUM MALUM HAIN KI YEH THMHARE SACHHA DOST NAHIN HAI,That is what probably made him decide that life was not for him.

r rather did you catch why? I feel like I must have missed something."
"nahin, mujhe lagata hai ki vah yuddh se vimukh tha aur hamane apanee bhaageedaaree ko kaise badhaaya tha.","No, I think he was just disenchanted with the war and how we had escalated our involvement. "
"ellsberg tho robert mcnamara se bol raha tha ki yeh war hopeless hein, even though voh voh public ke saath bole ki yeh ache jaayega aur voh disillusioned ban gaye aur truth leak karne ke decide kiya","Apparently Ellsberg overheard Robert McNamara saying he thought the war was hopeless, even though he was telling the public it was going well, and he became disillusioned about that and decided to leak the truth."

"isme itne sare detail the muje idea nahi tha,aur muje pasant aya watergate scandal nixon ke saath",There were so many details I had no idea about. And I like how it sort of set the stage for the Watergate scandal right afterwards with Nixon.
mai ant ka seen bilkul bhul gayamoive ki summary milne par laga yah yek saal bad,"I completely forgot about that scene at the end! Just got some details for the movie summary, and it mentions that. I guess that was one year later."

 went to the Supreme Court?"
"muje jesse plemons ke lawyer vale sabhi  seen pasand  ,muje lagta hai usne as sabi ceejo ko achi trah nibaya ,,muje achtray hua usaki boli sabi line actual fact par thi","Honestly, I really liked all of the scenes with Jesse Plemons as the lawyer. I thought he nailed it as far as lawyers taking a straight line even when something outside the box comes up. I wondered if the lines he spoke were based on facts and actual testimony."
ise laga jaise hum hi bat kar rahe ho,It looks like we're all done here - thanks for chatting!
"mai  lawyer ke bare jayda nahi socha,maine keval yah socha dusre paper kasi support kare",I don't remember much about the lawyer. I just liked how the other newspapers picke dup the mantle to support the Post and Times.

Sahi hai but than they could make a third movie jahan officer learns bure logo ko kaisse defeat kare..,true but than they could make a third movie where the officer learns how to defeat the guy eventually.
I see your point. Lekin kujhe darr hai ki you may dissuade people from watching a third movie agar unko second movie mein villian ka jeetna pasand nahi aaya .,I see your point.

lagata hai ki tum bahut chaalaak ho! vidambana hai ki unhonne philm mein naav ka naam orka rakha hai. un orchas bahut surakshit maana jaata hai,sounds like you're pretty clever! Ironic they named the boat the Orca in the movie. Those Orcas are supposed to be pretty safe.

Hello?,Hello!
Hello to hum aaj jis movie k baare me baat karege wo hai Batman V Superman,Hello so the movie we will be talking about is Batman V. Superman
"Great, maine abhi tak wo dekhi nahi hai, but sahi me dekhna chahta hu. Batman aur Superman kaun actors bane hai?","Great! I haven't actually seen that yet, but have been really wanting to. Which actors play Batman and Superman?"
"Actors sahi me acche hai aur tum probably sabhi ko jaante ho. Unme se kuch Ben Affleck , Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, and Jesse Eisenberg hai","The actors are really great and you probably know all of them. Ben Affleck , Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, and Jesse Eisenberg to name a few."
"Oh, ye to badhiya cast hai? Henry Cavill ne latest Superman film me Superman play kiya tha na?","Oh, that is a great cast? Henry Cavill played Superman in the latest Superman film right?"
Sorry badhiya cast hai!,"Sorry, a great cast!"
Main sure to nahi but ye movie DC extended universe ka part hai. Also isme wonder woman bhi ayegi,I am not sure but the film is still a part of the DC extended universe. Also it will be featuring wonder woman.
Oooh ye to excellent hai. Mujhe Wonder Woman dekhni hai. Kya film k start me Batman aur Superman dushman hai?,"Ooh, that is excellent. I am looking forward to seeing Wonder Woman! Are Batman and Superman enemies at the start of the film?"
Well Lex Batman ko Superman se ladne me manipulate kar deta hai because wo superman ko clone kar ke liye obssessed hai.,Well lex luthor manipulates batman into a battle with Superman because he is obssessed with cloning superman.
Oh! To Batman Superman ko Lex Luthor k paas leke jata hai,Oh! So Batman is supposed to bring Superman to Lex Luthor?
"Nahi, waise nahi hota hai but wo use help karne me manipulate ho jata hai. By the way kya maine mention kiya ye pahli movie hai jisme batman aur superman saath me hai?",No that is not the case however he is manipulated into helping. By the way did I mention this is going to be the first time batman and superman are in a movie together?
Really? pahli baar? Ye jaante huye ke dono character itne time se hai ye cheez to bahut amazing hai. Bahut cool. Story Metropolis me set hai k gotham me?,Really? The first time? That seems pretty amazing knowing that the characters have been around for so long! Very cool. Is the story set in Metropolis or Gotham?
"Aisa lagta hai k film dono cities me hoti hai, aur Batman ko lagta hai k Superman humanity k liye ek threat hai.","The film appears to take place in both cities, and Batman comes to view Superman as a threat to humanity."
"yeh tho interesting hei yar, is film tho dono cities ke hein. tho batman ko aasan padega us superman ka duty karne mein?","That is interesting, to have the film set in both cities. So Batman sees it as his duty somewhat to take Superman down?"
tho is characters ka relationships tho bada complex hein yar kyon ki clark kent ke vaje. superman tho batmans ka justice method learn kiya aur usse expose bhi kiya. tho lex luthor ne kryptonite ko approval kiya us senator se,Well the relationships of the characters are quite complex because Clark Kent A.K.A. Superman learns of Batman's justice methods and tries to expose him. All this happening while Lex luthor makes moves to get approval to obtain kryptonite from a senator.
"interesting yar, mein ab is story ko imagine ki.. tho uska greater purpose kya hein? kya voh dono superheroes ko jaanthi hein?","Interesting. And so, I imagine Lois Lane is in this story? If so, does she serve a greater purpose? Does she know both superheroes?"
mein kuch sure nahi hoon. kya aap reviews ke anusar movie dekhne chalte?,Maybe but I am not sure. By the way do you usually care about reviews?
mein tho reviews ke anusar hi jaatha ki kaise logo is movie ko dekhthe lekin mein reviews se apna mind change nahi kartha. muje lagtha hein ki yeh sab bakvas hein. kya aap review ko care karte?,"I will often read reviews to see what people have to say, but I don't change my mind about wanting to see a movie based on reviews. I think that I can't really know unless I see for myself. Do you care about reviews?"
nahi yar mein apne aap judge kartha.. lekin kuch reviews tho overwhelmingly acha ya bura hota jo muje theathres mein movie dekhte samai relate kartha hoon. muje lagtha hein ki is movies ka reviews thoda mixed hein,Not usually I like to be my own judge however if the reviews are overwhelmingly bad or good then it may influence whether or not I watch in theatres. I have to say for this movies though the reviews are quite mixed. 
kya aap is film ko enjoy kiya?,Did you enjoy this film?
haan yar.. muje vakahi mein is scene pasand hein .. batman tho superman ko kisi tarah manage kar raha tha,I did. I really liked seeing the scenes where batman manages to subdue the superman.
cool.. tho konsa yeh beat karega? kya yeh film teamup hoga?,"Cool. I guess that's one of the ultimate questions, which one could beat out the other. Do they team up at all in the film
?"
haan... isme tho batman ne superman ka mom ko bachana ke liye choose kiya lekin superman tho lex ko confonts,Yes in Batman chooses to save Supermans mother while Superman confonts Lex.
"oh wow! Batman aur Superman ke mom ki pairing really sabse cool part tha story ka, heartwarming.","Oh wow! The pairing of Batman and Superman's mom is a really cool part of the story, heartwarming."
I know but sadly fim ka end Superman ki death ke sath hota hai.,I know but the film ends with sadly the death of Superman.
"oh wow! mujhe surprise hua isse, I thought wo log apni story line ko aage badhne denge aage ki ek do aur movie ke liye.","Oh wow! I am surprised by that, I thought they would keep their story line going for another movie or two. "
Don't worry coffin ke upar ki dhool ko hilte hue dikhaya director ne kisi badhiya wink ki tarah.,Dont worry the dirt on top of the coffin vibrates a nice wink from the Director.

I wonder wo kaunse dusre continent me pahle expand karna chahte the","I love how he was doing it from a house. You know that much happened. If Sean Parker was there, who knows. I love how tech company start ups are out of houses. I wonder what the other continent was they were trying to expand to first."
"I think  uski success ko consider  karte hue Thefacebook kafi funny hai. Pahle Facesmash, phir Harvard Connection phir TheFacebook yikes!","I think that it is pretty funny considering the success he gained... and ""Thefacebook""? First Facesmash, then Harvard Connection then Thefacebook... yikes!"

Usne duniya ka sabse bada social network banaya but wo ek aisa aadmi lagta hai jise log hate karte hai,"He founded the biggest social network the world has ever seen, but he seems like a person who people hate."

The Inception ko 86% ka Rotten Tomatoes rating given he.,The Inception was given a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 86%.
"me dekha  Leonardo DiCaprio isme starred he as well as Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page aur Tom Hardy.","I see Leonardo DiCaprio starred in it as well as Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page and Tom Hardy."
"86% fair rating he. Mujhe laga ki ye movie excellent he but somewhat ""heady"" he.me dekh sakta hu ki kyu ye everyone ka cup of tea he.Tum Inception ko kya rating dete?",86% is a fair rating.  I felt that this movie was excellent but somewhat 'heady'.  I could see why it isn't everyone's cup of tea.  What rating would you give Inception?
me agree hu. 86% fair lagti he.,I agree. 86% seems fair. 
Is movie me kuch interesting character the.Kis character se tum sabse adhik relate karte ho?,There were some interesting characters in this movie. What character did you relate to most?
"Leonardo DiCaprio, Dom ke role me Compelling tha.The Inception ka role lagta he ki DiCaprio ke liye tailor fit role tha.mene uska performance enjoy kiya but  mujhe laga ki role itna inventive tha ki kis bhi character se directly  relate karna mere liye  hard he.",Leonardo DiCaprio was compelling in the role of Dom.  The Inception seems like a tailor fit role for DiCaprio.  I enjoyed his performance but found that the plot was so inventive that I had a hard time relating directly to any of the characters.  It seemed too divorced from reality.
Kya is movie ne tumhe tumhari soch ke baare mein sochne pe majboor kiya?,Did this movie make you ponder the origins of your own thoughts?
"Well, kam bolna interesting tha. Kisi dusre ke subconscious mein kuch plant karne ke idea nei mujhe sure kar diya.","Well, it was interesting, to say the least. The idea of planting something into another persons subconscious made me think for sure. "
Bahar bahut sunder h.,"It was pretty ""out there""."
Kya tumhe scientific movies h?,Do you like scientific movies?
I unse pyar h. Bahar bahut better h.,"I adore them.  The more ""out there"" the better.  "
kya tumne movie mein dreamscapes ki complexity ko notice kiya? Mujhe laga yaha bahut inventive h.,Did you notice the complexity of the dreamscapes in the movie? I thought it was very inventive.
Mujhe kuch specific yaad nai aa rahi h. yaha believe karna mushkil h ki yaha movie 10 saal purani h! Mujhe yaad aa raha h ki yaha din b din complex and dream like ho rhi h.,I'm having a hard time recalling some of the specifics.  It's hard to believe this film is almost 10 years old already!  I do recall them growing increasingly more complex and dream like the deeper they went though.
kya tune notice kiya ki har ek dream mein ek kick h,"Did you notice in each dream there was a ""kick""?"
"Maine kiya, yaha mujhe pasand h! Yaha dremy Rube Goldberg contraption ki tarah h.","I did, I loved it!  It was like a dreamy Rube Goldberg contraption.  "
kya tum apne aap ko same scenario mein imagine kar sakte ho? Unme bahut jyada trust hona chahiye. Yadi kuch bhi wrong hota h to wo limlbe mein khatm ho sakta h,Can you imagine yourself in a similar scenario?  They must have had a tremendous amount of trust for each other.  If anything went wrong they could have ended up in 'limbo'.  
mein imagine bhi nahi saktha. voh toh badi risky sound kartha. expecially voh dreamer apna dream mein hi mar jaatha uska sedative wear karne ke pehle hi,I couldn't imagine it. Sounds very risky. Especially if the dreamer dies in the dream before the sedative wears off.
agar dreamer mar gaya toh limbo mein end hotha. kaise aise kar sakthe? sabhi extractors issi consciousness mein hi jee rahe hein. kya yeb sab ban baayenge?,"If the dreamer died and you end up in 'limbo', where do you think that is?  All of the extractors are living within that consciousness, what would become of them?  (since if he dies, that consciousness will cease to exist.)"
ache question kaafi provoking thought hein. is movie mein voh limbo ke liye gaye hein kyon ki mein subconscious dream par is scenario ko nahi mil paatha. bahut scary dream hein. kya aap ko is potential setback ke baare mein kya haal chaal hein,"Good question, and very thought provoking. In the movie they just went into limbo but I suppose the subconscious dreams would have to adjust to fit the new scenario. It would be scary to have the possibility of forgetting that you are in a dream at all. Do you think it would be worth
 the potential setback?"
muje lagtha hein ki is setback thoda jyada hein. muje lagtha hein ki sabhi extractors ko is subject ko trapped kiye gaye hein. is tarah mein toh yeh jyada risky nazar aa raha hein. uska aim ka plant toh koi dusri ka idea hoga jo koi mind control kiya hein. mein soch raha hun ki voh jyada easier ho tha aur risky bhi kam hota aur negotiate bhi kar sakthe. magar sab koi subversive nahi hote,"I think that possibility is much greater than a setback.  I took it to mean that all the extractors as well as the subject would be trapped forever.  In that way it seems much too risky.  The aim is to plant an idea in someones mind without their realizing it, almost like mind control.  I think it would me much easier, and less risky, to sit and negotiate with someone.  Although, that's not at all subversive.  "
ache point hein. toh aap us mal ko kya huva?,Good point. What did you think about what happened to Mal?
"mal ka conflick is film mein pivotal hein. toh sabhi intrigue ko is dream ka target diving hota hein, Mals ka action plant ka idea toh badi layers hein.. reality mein toh is film thoda jyada hi reality ho gaya. kya aap kya sochte hein?","Mal's conflict is pivotal to this film.  For all the layers of intrigue we have diving down into the dreams of the target, Mal's actions plant the idea in our minds that there could be many layers above as well.  Is the reality we began this film in reality at all?  What do you think?"
"hakikath mein toh jeena thoda kasth hein. agar koi alternate reality hein toh maja aatha, muje toh us mal ko reality mein believe hi nahi hota. uska dream toh badi detailed aur believable thi ki koi convinced ho saktha. agar mal suicide karne ka dream aatha jab utne se, toh mein reality par believe karte. kya cobb ko, mals ka murder charges lagane ka faisla thik tha?","Reality as we know it can be hard. If there was an alternate reality available that was more enjoyable I could see where Mal would want to believe it was the ""real"" reality. The dreams would have to be extremely detailed and believable to be that convinced. Since Mal committed suicide to attempt to ""wake up"" for real, I assume the beginning reality was the ""real"" one. Do you think Cobb should face murder charges for Mal's death?"
"bilkul nahi yar, audience ko sach patha hota hei","Absolutely not, the audience knows the real truth."
mein bhi agree karunga,I tend to agree. 
yeh sabhi baath hein ki ariadne ko us fisher ne acha kick setup kiya jab wake up hote par,It's a good thing Ariadne had the kick setup for Fischer to wake up.
yeh acchi baat hai ki pakde nahi gaye. marte huye parents ki memories bohot strong hoti hai. kya aise ek nayi memory tumhe apni life change karne par majbor karegi?,It is a good thing they didn't get trapped.  Memories of a dying parent would be very strong.  Would a new memory like this make you change your life?
mujhe lagta hai ha. mai apne marte huye parents ki iccha zarur puri karunga. tum?,I think it would. I would want to honor my dying parents requests. How about you?
mai bhi. kya tum humesha k liye ek dream me rahoge agar tumhe reality pasand ho?,I would too.  Would you stay in a dream forever if it were the reality you loved?  
"bohot tempting hoga wo. tumhe kaisa lagega yeh jaan k ki bhale hi tum ek dream me ho par phir bhi tum age kar rahe aur ek life ji rahe? jab jagoge toh tum bohot young hoge dream me. tumhe lagta hai yeh yakeen karna mushkil hoga, actual reality?","It would certainly be tempting! How odd would it be to know you are in a dream yet you are getting older, living a whole life? Waking up, you'd be much younger then in the dream. Do you think that would make it more difficult to believe that it is the actual reality?"
"waise, it depends. mai abhi budha ho raha aur mujhe lagta hai yeh reality hai. mujhe waise yeh sahi me accha lagega agar mai maru aur phir se zinda jab hou tab young ho jau! waise mujhe yeh manne me koi pareshaani nahi ki yeh sacchai hai kuiki mujhe isse better kuch pata nahi hai. agar yeh ek sapna hai toh mai yaha rehna chachunga kyuki jab mai jagunga toh mujhe ek extra life jeene ko milegi. tum kya sochate ho?","Well, it depends.  I'm growing older right now but I believe this is reality.  I'd certainly be happy to die, but then wake up a younger man!  But I have no difficulty believing this is reality because I don't know any better right now.  If I did know this was a dream I'd be happy to stay here because I'd get to live a whole extra life before my next.  What would you do?"
"mujhe pata nahi, par mujhe yeh zarur lagta hai ki mera mind itna bada dhokha nahi karega mere saath. ""maine ek jeevan jiya. ek aur kaise ji sakta mai?"" bohot pareshaani hogi yakeen karne me","Honestly, I'm not sure but I think it would make my mind play trick on me. ""Wait, I just lived my life. How can I now be in a different one?"" It would definitely hard to grasp."
tum kya sochate ho spinning top totem k baare me?,What did you think of the spinning top totem?
mujhe lagta hai wo ek perfect cinematic device hai. jo spinning hai wo itna excitement create karti ki ab next kya hoga. kya hoga agar sab bigad gaya? bohot hi zyada thrill.,"I thought it was the perfect cinematic device.  The spinning creates so much anticipation for what comes next.  Will it fall over, won't it?  Puts you on the edge of your seat."
tum kis type ka totem pasand karoge?,What kind of totem do you think you would have?
mujhe lagta hai eight ball accha hoga aur anticipation create karega,I think an eight ball would be exciting and create anticipation.

Toothless mera favorite dragon hai,Toothless is my favorite dragon
Toothless ek great character hai. Hiccup asal me use maarne wala tha but mar nahi paya aur use free kar diya,Toothless is a great character. Hiccup was supposed to kill him in the beginning but couldn't bring himself to do it and instead sets him free
Wo gradually dragon ko tame karta hai aur use toothless bulata hai kyuki uske retractable teeth hai,He gradually tames the dragon and calls him toothless because of his retractable teech
Toothless ki wajah se Hiccup baki dragons ko bhi tame karna seekh gaya,It was becuase of toothless that Hiccup learned how to tame other dragons
Kya tumhe lagta hai hiccup cheat karta jo bhi toothless se seekha? ( apni training class me wo chez use karke?),Do you think Hiccup cheats because of what he learns from Toothless ? (by using it his training class?)
"wo captive dragons ko vas karne me kushal ho gaya, uko aap cheating kaise keh sakte hai?","He become proficient in subduing the captive dragons, i don't know how much you can call that cheating"
Lekin wo ye Toothless ke bina nahi jan pata.,But he wouldn't have known that without having Toothless. 
to sayad wo advantage ho cheating nahi,so maybe just an advantage not cheating 
Aapko kya lag raha he ki stoick Hiccup ke sath kya kar raha hai?,How do you feel about how Stoick treats Hiccup?
"stoick Hiccup ko chhod raha hai, lekin phir ghar mein becheni se pahuncha aur paaya ki Hiccup ne dragons ko kis tarah prashikshit kiya tha","Stoick leaving Hiccup, but then arriving home unscucessful and finding how Hiccup had trained the dragons led to a celebration"
Mera matalab hai puri movie ke dauran. vah suruat mein usake prati kathor nahin tha,i mean throughout the whole movie. he was rather harsh to him in the beginning
Stoick Hiccup ka upayog karata hai jab Hiccups ko akasmik rup se pata chalata hai ki Toothless Dragon ke ghosle ka pata laga sakata hai. Stoick ne apane bete ko nanga kar diya,Stoick uses Hiccup when Hiccups accidently reveals that Toothless can locate the dragon's nest. Stoick disowns his son
Mere liye yah bahut harsh hai,That to me is very harsh
"halaki, jab Hiccup lagabhag toothless ko chhudane ki koshish mein doob jata hai, to stoick apane bete ke saath un dono ko bacha leta hai","However, when Hiccup almost drowns trying to free toothless, Stoick saves them both, reconciling with his son"
kya aapako ending pasand aaya? ve Hiccup aur Toothless ko mul rup se samaan kaise banate hain? (donon me kuchh vital yaad aa rahee hai?),Did you like the ending? how they make Hiccup and Toothless basically equal? (both missing something vital?)

Basically they enter into someone's dreams to find out information.

"Inception ka bhi rotten tomatoes par score 86% hai, jo ki kafi high hai.",Inception also has a rotten tomatoes score of 86% which is really high.

"scene me bahut sare aadmi swapn me kho jaath hai .koi unko jagane aur bachane ki zaroorat hai. par koi log swapn me ghaayal ho gaye aur marnevale the aur  ""limbo"" ho jaathe hai.","So there's this scene where multiple people are going into a dream. So they need to have someone ""kick"" them awake at the same time to escape. However, someone gets wounded in the dream
 and are almost dying and they get sent into ""limbo""."
kya hoga agar woh swapn me mar jaathe hai tho? uska natheeja kya hoga,and what happens if the die in the dream? what are the consequences of this

Leonardo Di Caprio ka is film me kya role hai?,And whats the role of Leonardo Di Caprio in this film?

Haan woh lead actor hai. Uska naam hai Dom Cobb aur uska specialization hai conning secrets from victims unke dreams mein.,Yeah he's the lead actor. His name is Dom Cobb and he specializes in conning secrets from victims in their dreams.
"""limbo"" world ke baare mein ek aur cheez hai ki eventually log bhool jaate hain ki jis duniye mein wo hain wo real nahi hai.","One more thing about the ""limbo"" world is that eventually people forget that the world they are in is not real."

"jab mike aur sully apne program finish nahi hote aur unhone saath ranks karne ke work kar rahe the, us scene ko muje pasand hein",I liked when Mike and Sully didn't finish the program and worked their way up the ranks anyways.

me bhi! toy story movies from pixar mere favorite movies hai.tereko pata hai kya wo log toy story land bana rahe hai walt disny world mai ye summer mai.,Me too! I think the Toy Story movies might be my favorite Pixar movies. Did you hear that they're building a Toy Story Land in Walt Disney World this summer?

"mai wdw ja raha hy, bahor excitement hai park dekhne ki, tu kabhi gaya hai ya disneyland ko ?",I'm going to WDW in the fall so I'm excited to see how the park is. Have you ever been? Or to Disneyland?
"ha wdw ko kuch bar gaya hu, disney land ko nahi gaya. california dur hai mujhse.hum camping krne gaye the wdw pichle sal. maja aaya tha.",I've been to WDW a few times.  Never to Disneyland though.  California is pretty far away from me.  We went camping at WDW last year though.  It was great.

tuzhe kya lagta hai,How about you?
mujhe mike pasand hai kyu ki wo bahot funny hai. usme kuch behterin lines hai movie ke.,I like Mike because he's funnier.  He had some of the best lines in the first movie.
voh funny hein,He is SO funny!! 
"muje tho hamesha goodman ka voice pasand hein, big aur fluffy monster ke liye tho perfect hein","I always liked John Goodman's voice acting for Sully, though. It's perfect for a big, fluffy monster"
"first movie ka end tho is part mein hein, jab voh microphone mein burps out kiya tho mera kids jor se has rahe they",The part at the end of the first movie when he burps out the microphone makes my kids laugh so hard.
"mein maantha hoon, john goodman ache choice hei sulley keliye",I agree. John Goodman was a great choice for Sulley.

"muje scare machien pasand hein, voh prequel mein hein, jo students ko frighten huve us contest keliye. pretty neat hein",I love the scare machine they had in the prequel that the students had to frighten for the contest. That was pretty neat

"sulley keliye tho yeh little out character hein, lekin conflict ke liye tho unke paas final source jarur hoga,","It seemed a little out of character for Sulley, but I guess they had to have some final source of conflict between the two to keep the plot moving."
"mein maantha hoon, yeh probably mera least favorite part hein is movie mien.. muje lagtha hein ki yeh story kuch different direction mein ja raha hein","I agree, it was probably my least favorite part of the movie. I feel like they could have taken the story in a different direction."
"sully ko mike ko trick karne ko soch de tho voh dar gaya, kitna hurtful hein",For Sully to trick Mike into thinking he was scary was just so hurtful! 
"muje us ending bahut pasand hein, jo apne dream achieve karne ke liye itna hard se work kiya.. ache message hein,disney ka... disney tho princess and the frog se start kiya aise message dene",I do like that they ended up working so hard to achieve their dreams though.  That's a good message that Disney started doing with the Princess and the Frog.
"muje bhi in dono movies ka common thread pasand hein... muje lagtha yeh thoda better se executed kiya hein, kyon ki bottom of monster se start kiya","Me too! I like that common thread between the two movies. I think it was executed better in this though, because they really did start from the very bottom of Monsters, Inch"
aur in mein explain kiya ki kaise voh janitors ka original moives se ache hein... same position mein tho hein voh,And it explains why they're always nice to the other nerdy janitors in the original movie.  They were once in that same position.

Be kind and respectful to everyone.  Don't expect to lean on your credentials or family reputation to get you somewhere in life.  Just be prepared to work your hardest.
"haan! muje bhi sully ka spoiled brat pehela pasand hein, jo apni family reputation ke liye kabhi lean nahi hota..",Yes! I liked that they showed Sully as this spoiled brat at first who eventually learned that you can't always lean on your family's reputation. It can only get you so far
"lekin uska background thoda spoiled hein, kyon ki voh competition mein cheat kiy.. lekin unka action ka consequences nahi realize huva, bas kya use right laga voh kar baita","Maybe his spoiled background is why he cheated in the competition, because he didn't really realize the consequences of his actions, just did what he thought was right"
I feel aajkal bahut se kids ko is meesage ki bahut jarurat hai.,I feel like a lot of kids need that message these days.
tumhare pass bahut badhiya point hai cheating ke baare men.,You've got a good point there about the cheating.
aur aapke pass yah badhiya point hai is message ka kids ki jaruraton ke baare me.,And you have a good point there about kids needing that message!
"maine ye baat like ki ki unko sath milke hard work karna pada, so aisa feel nahi aaya ki ye koi jyada struggle tha. Because Mike and Sully ko ek dusre ke sath the unka struggle share karne me jab wo corporate  ladder chadh rahe the.","I like that they had to work hard together too, so it didn't feel like so much of a struggle. Because Mike and Sully had each other to share in that struggle of working their way up the corporate ladder"

Yeh Batman aur Superman ki sathme aisi pehli movie hai.,It's the first movie like this with Batman and Superman together.
Sunkar achha laga,That sounds good

Superman ka role kisne nibhata hai?,Who plays Superman?
Henry Cavill. Wonder kaun sath me hoga.,"Henry Cavill.  Wonder Wo
man is in it too."

mai uske nam par sure nahi hu.lekin  sayad Laurence Fishburne aur HolLy Hunter  ho sakta hai,"I'm not sure of her name, b
ut Laurence Fishburne and Holly Hunter are in it too."
mai un dono ko pasand karta hu movie ki sound achi hai  aur kitna der,I like both of them. The movie sounds good. How long is it?
ye 153 minut so long .yaha yek hissa jaha way/batmanne indian ocean me krytonite paya,It's 153 minutes so it's fairly long.  There's a part where Bruce Wayne/Batman seeks out kryptonite in the Indian Ocean as a deterrent.
ishe bahut acha critic score nahi mile,It didn't get very good critics scores.
"yah yek lambi moive hai ,muje lambi moive pasand hai khaskar theater me ,iski sounds majedar hai.kritic ne iske bare me kya kaha","That is a long movie. I enjoy long movies, especially in the theaters. It sounds interesting. What did the critics have to say about it?"
"cinema score ne ishe b grad diya,rotten tomatoes ne 4.9/10 aur  Metacritic  ne 44/100,yek critic ne khayah ki ye dark night jaisi achi nahi par man of steel se achi hai","CinemaScore graded it as a B, Rotten Tomatoes 4.9/10 and Metacritic Score was 44/100. One of the critics said it wasn't as good as Dark Knight but it was better than Man of Stee."
istel,Steel.
wah ye to vastav me kam score hai.vaise jayadatar eshi moives popular hoti hai aur acha pradsan karti  hai,Wow. Those are really low scores! I am surprised at that. Usually these types of movies are popular and do well.
ha mai manta hu moive ke yek hisse maisuperman ki mom kidnap huyi aur kidnaper ne kaha ki vo uski maa ke badle batman ko marega,"Yeah, agreed.  In one part of the movie, Superman's mom gets kidnapped and the kidnapper demands he kill Batman for his Mom's release."
aur phir uski mom release hone k baad kya hoga?,And what happens once his mom is released?
"Wo waise release nahi hoti hai, kyuki Batman Superman ko maarne se theek pahle samjh jata hai k dono ko trick kiya gaya hai. Batman Superman ki mom ko bachata hai aur superman kidnapper k peeche jata hai","She isn't released that way, because Batman realizes right before he kills Superman that they are both being tricked.  Batman ends up rescuing Superman's Mom, and Superman goes after the kidnapper."
Kya Superman kidnapper k sath ladta hai?,Does Superman have a fight with kidnapper?
Kaun jeetta hai?,And who wins
"Haan, Superman kidnapper ko confront karta hai, jiska naam Luthor hai, Jesse Eisenberg ne play kiya hia, Kryptonian scout ship pe","Yes, Superman confronts the kidnapper, whose name is Luthor, played by Jesse Eisenberg, on the Kryptonian scout ship."

"Luthor arrest hojata hai phir Batman usse visit karne jail me jata hai. Main tumhe fight ka outcome nahi batana chahta kyuki main ending ruin nahi karna chahta. No, Wonder Woman ka bahut bada part nahi hai","Luthor gets arrested and then Batman goes to visit him in prison.  I don't want to tell you the outcome of the fight because I don't want to ruin the ending.  No, Wonder Woman doesn't have a very big part."
"Mujhe Wonder Woman bahut pasand hai! Haan, outcome mat batao kyuki mujhe ye movie dekhni hai","I love Wonder Woman! Yes, don't give away the outcome because I want to see it! "
"Mujhe lagta hai tumhe bahut pasand aayegi. Main critics ki baat hamesha nahi maanta, pata nahi kya chal rah hai unke sath.","I think you'll really like it.  I don't always believe the critics, you never know what else is going on with them."
Mujhe bhi wahi lagta hai. Main bhi unki jyada baat nahi sunta. Maine kaafi bahut acchi movies dekhi hai jiski critics ne dhajjia uda di thi.,I think I would too. I try not to listen too much to them either. I have seen some really good movies that the critics just rip to shreds. 
Ho sakata hai usee veekend koee philm aa rahee ho jisamen ve nirdeshak se dostee kar rahe the ya kuchh aisa kar rahe the.,There may have been a movie coming out the same weekend they were friends with the director or something loke that.
Pasand,like

"mujhe jo yaad hai, yah bhavishy mein hai isalie insaanon kee ladaee ke bajaay, robot ladate hain.","From what I remember, this is in the future so instead of humans fighting, robots fight."
"aur mujhe lagata hai ki hyoog robot kee ladaee mein achchha hua karata tha, lekin tab unhen kuchh samasyaen theen aur ve ab achchhe nahin the",and I guess Hugh used to be good at robot fighting but then they had some problems and they weren't good anymore.
lekin phir ve ek behatar robot dhoondhate hain aur phir se achchhe hote hain,But then they find a better robot and are good again.
"previews se lagtha hein ki, yeh kuch simplistic popcorn movie hein",seemed like a simplistic popcorn movie from the previews

"muje nahi lagtha ki yeh mature movie hein, kids ke tarah hi hey","I don't think it was a mature movie though, it was marketed towards kids (teens)"
choti kids ke nahi,not little kids
14 saal ka kids ke hein,like the kind of movie you'd take a 14 year old to
"mein ab bhi isse padthi hoon, stupid ke tarah sound kar raha hein lekin muje is stupid tho enjoy karthi hoon","In fact now that I read this, it sounds like one of the movies that is so stupid it might be ""stupid enjoyable"""
"ha, ye definitely uski tarah sound karta he.","Yeah, it definitely sounds like that."
probably ye ek feel good movie he jisme vi sabkuch conquer kar lete he,probably a feel good movie where they conquer all
kya ye kahata he ki unhe us document me kis type ki problem aayi.,Does it say what kind of problems they have in that document?
jese ki main plot kis bare me he,like what the main plot is about
"ye bhi vesa hi sound karta he,mujhe lagata he, Bred Pitt movies underground fight venues ki bar me hoti he.","This also sounds like that , I think, Brad pitt movie about underground fight venues"
ha Koi bhi other character Brad PItt ke character ki tarah crazy nahi he,yeah except nobody is crazy like the brad pitt character
"illegal, law ki view ke outside kiya jana chahiye","Illegal, mush be done out of the view of the law"

Bad me wo ek amazing robot find kar rahe the aur bdla liya,then they find an amazing robot and get their revenge

MAIN MAIREELAIND MEIN STHIT HOON. MAINNE SOCHA THA KI HAM VYAKTIGAT JAANAKAAREE DENE KE LIE NAHIN HAIN.,I'm located in Maryland. I thought we aren't suppose to give personal information.
VULPH OPH VOL SADAK AMERIKA MEIN BAHUT PRASIDDH HAI.,Wolf of Wall street is pretty famous in the US.
"YAH SIRPH MUJHE THODA VICHITR LAGA KI KOEE US PHILM KO NAHIN JAANATA HAI, ISALIE MAINNE POOCHHA.","It just seemed a little bizarre to me that someone didn't know that movie,so I asked."
HAAN. MAINNE ISAKE BAARE MEIN SUNA HAI LEKIN ISE KABHEE NAHIN DEKHA. MUJHE EKSHAN PHILMEN PASAND HAIN.,Yes. I've heard of it but never seen it. I like action movies.
"THEEK HAI. MAIN ISE DEKHANE KEE KOSHISH KARANE KEE SALAAH DETA HOON, YAH EK BEHATAREEN PHILM HAI.","Okay. I recommend trying to watch it, it's a great movie."
"MUJHE LAGATA HAI KI MERE PATI AUR BETEE NE ISE KHAREEDA HAI, MUJHE NAHIN. PHIR SE, MUJHE EKSHAN PHILMEN PASAND HAIN LEKIN MERE PATI KO GAINGASTAR AUR KOMEDEE DEKHANA BAHUT PASAND HAI. VAH HAMESHA MUJHE CHIDHAATE HAIN KI MAIN KEVAL ABHINETAON KE LIE EKSHAN PHILMEN DEKHANA CHAAHATA HOON.","I think my husband and daughter have watched it buy not me. Again, I like action movies but my husband loves watching gangster and comedies. He always teases me that I only want to watch action movies for the actors."
"HAAHA, KYA VAH SAHEE HAI?]","Haha, is he right ?]"
"MUJHE KARANA PAD SAKATA HAI. MAIN EK PUSTAK VYAKTI SE ADHIK HOON, KYONKI YAH MUKHY CHARITR DVAARA LIKHEE GAEE PUSTAK PAR AADHAARIT HAI ISALIE MAIN PUSTAK KO PADHANE KE LIE ADHIK UPAYUKT HOGA.",I might have to. I am more of a book person so since it's based on a book written by the main character I would be more apt to read the book.
"ha, kabhi vo sahi hoti hai ki mai kyo avtion moive dekhta hu","Yeah, sometimes he is right that is why I watch the action movies lol."
yah mmoive book me based hai,The movie is based on a book.
"ish moive ki summary depressing hai,moive ka character imandar nahi malum parta aur vah arrest ho jata hai,muje lagta hai vah apni life se seek leta haijab vah book liogta hai",The summary of the movie seems kind of depressing. The main character doesn't seem honest and he gets arrested. I'm guessing he overall learned his lesson since he wrote a book about his life story.
"muje yah accha nahi laga,jab kisi me bahut kuch kare ki abuility par lalach ke chhaker me vah bhrast ho jata aur apni life barbad kar leta haiha moive kafi entertaining",It actually sounds sad to me. Someone that has the potential to make alot of money at work and ends up getting greedy and corrupt and ruins their life.
"ha moive kafi entertaining  hai.sayad summary emo ne likhi hai,puri moive majedar hai last ke das min ke siva","Yeah, the movie is pretty entertaining. The summary might have been written by an emo. Lol. The entire movie is fun, other than the last 10 mins or so."
"kulmilakar ant acha tha,uske pas parivar aur sabkuch tha",Overall he ended up fine. Has a family and everything
kuch samay ke liye vah t.v par guest tha,He is on TV sometimes as a guest 
"oh yah thik tha,vah teen saal ke liye jail gaya vah jayada time nahi hota achyar use sach me dukh hua apni jingi ka ya keval paise barbad hone ka",Oh well that's good. I see he went to jail for 3 years. That's not too long. I wonder if he truly regrets ruining his life or just regrets losing all the money.
usne ashan aur quick paisa kamaya jabki usne stock market ko luta,"He made that money quick and easy, while cheating the stock market."
"vah yek intelligent vaykti tha,bari sarm hai ki sara talent barbad ho gaya","He must be a really intelligent person, what a shame to waste all that talent."
3 saal se kuch nahi,3 years was nothing.
"haan, 3 saal tho short hein","Yeah, 3 years is short."
"well, voh ab bhi millionaire  hein","Well, he still is a millionaire."
"are wow, muje is bare mein kuch nahi patha. except us 22$ million ka swiss account.. tho aise hi voh millionaire huve?",Oh wow. That I didn't know and it doesn't say. Except it says he hid $22 million in a Swiss account. Is that how he's still a millionaire?
"agar voh previously saare money lost kiya tha lekin voh movie ko ache tarah deal kiya, book ko bhi,, aur kahi millions tho apne speaking fees se banaya","Even if he lost all the money he made previously, his movie deal, book deal and speaking fees has made him millions"
"aapko patha hein, agar usse new family hota tho uska 2nd wife jo naomi tho jarur divorce karthi",Do you know if he has a new family because it says his 2nd wife Naomi wanted a divorce and full custody of their children.
"muje itna detail nahi patha, mein unka daughter aur unka talk dekha hein, thoda happy nazar aa rahe the","I don't know much in detail but ,I watched him talk about his daughter once and he seemed pretty happy about where he is now."
voh kahathe hei ki yahi unka life ka mistakes hein,He does say that he has made mistakes in his life.
"acha sahi, muje is tarah ka movies jaise real life stories dekhna pasand hein",Oh well that's good. I do like movies (and books) based on real life stories.
"mein bhi try karunga, acha hein","Try watching it , its a good one."
ham baate karme mei achche lag rahe the,Looks like we did good on the chat
mera khayal hai mere pass hai. yadi usne mera attention 30 min ke liye le liya to mei dhekhunga. khabhi kabhi mei movei dekhane se pahale Wikipedia mei dekhata hui,I think I might have to. If it keeps my attention through the first 30 minutes I'll keep watching it. Sometimes I cheat and wikipedia movies to see what they are about before watching them.
"haa, mere khayalhai ki ye bahut achi baate hai","yes, I think this is a good chat."
chalo isko lapet lete hai,Let's wrap it up

"ee film tho bahut great bada actors tha, ee tho dusara reason hi mere kho aacha laga aur mene dekungi bina actors keliye.","The film has several great big name actors, which is another reason I like this one and would watch it based on the actors alone"
"ha, bahut sara great actors hi Batman Begins me. mene like karungi Liam Neeson tho bi, vo tho eek villain be hi.","I agree, there are quite a few great actors in Batman Begins. I like Liam Neeson too, even though he is one of the villains."
"utna potential hi actors me dekhke big screen mere kho bahut interest aaya tha. milke dono super heros aur villans bhi hi. isko aacha rating help karega , mene time waste mat karungi dusara awful movie dekhke.","seeing the potential for great actors together on a big screen defiantly gets my interest. along with super heros and villans.  a good 
rating does help me feel like I will not waste my time watching something awful"
lekin same time me mene nahi deter karungi ee film se if mene just genre dekhke.,but the same time will not deter me from a film If i am just into the genre
Main personally acchi ratings prefer karta hun .Even agar kisi movie mein kayi acche actors hain lekin agar uski rating kharab hai to main usko usually theaters mein nahi dekhta.,"I personally prefer good ratings. Even if a movie has many good actors, if it's rated poorly, I usually won't watch it in theaters."
Waise mein sure nahi hun ki mein Metacritic  ke 70/100 score se agree karunga.,"I'm not sure if I agree with the Metacritic Score of 70/100, though."

Generally mere paas enough patience hota hai to wait for a film to be released on DVD/Video agar mujhe rating pasand nahi aati.,I will generally have enough patience to wait for a film to be released on DVD/Video if the rating turn me off.
Movie ke bat scene ke baare mein kya khyal hai ?,What did you think of the bat scene in the movie?
"Main sochta hun ki ye scene shows the story of this film well, kaafi socha samjha hai.","I felt that scene shows the story of this film well, and is thought out."
Waise I wonder ki bats ke liye dry well se behtar koi place ho sakti thi kya,"I wonder if there was a better place for the bats besides a dry well, though."
batman as a child accha step tha by the filmmaker ye dikhane ke liye ki uski life kaise start hui,"batman as a child was good step by the filmm
aker to show how his life started out"
Because movie ka naam Batman Begins hai so I agree ki Bruce ki shuruaati life dikhana appropriate hai.,"Because this movie is called Batman Begins, I agree that it was appropriate to show Bruce's beginnings."
"Mere khyal se ye ironic hi hai ki mugger's name is Joe Chill , lekin wo chill nahi hai if he murders people.","I think it's ironic that the mugger's name is Joe Chill, but he isn't
 chill if he murders people."
"unlikely haan, mujhe lagta hai wo batman kaise bana k ek mysterious beginning dikhana chahte the, but phir bhi thodi mystery chhodna chahte the ke use bats ka phobia kaise hota hai.","unlikely yes, I think they were going for a mysterious beginning to show how batman came to be.  but still want to leave some mystery as he still develops a phobia to 
 the bats"
"bahut ironic, mr chill to ek bone chilling murdered hai","very ironic. mr chill is more of a bone 
chilling murderer. "
"Uska bhi murder hojata hai, to kam se kam wo jo deserve karta hai use mil jata hai","He is also murdered too, so at least he gets what he deserves."
Jo uske liye hona tha usko mil jata hai. But brucse uska murder nahi karta to main sochta hu wo uski badla leni ki chahat rah jaati hai.,"he got whats coming to him. but 
bruce dosent get to murder him so i think that leaves him wanting revenge "
"Mujhe lagta hai iss ye establish hone me help hoti hai k Bruce kabhi kisi ka directly murder nahi karte. Even jab wo league of Shadows ko jala deta hai, Ra's al Ghul ko directly nahi maarta hai.","I think it helps to establish that Bruce will not directly murder anyone. Even when he burns down the League of Shadows, he doesn't directly kill Ra's al Ghul."
Injustice kabhi bhi murder ka reason nahi hona chaiye,"Injustice should be not be used as a reason to murder, in any case."
Mujhe lagta hai ke wo lucky tha k league of shadows ka part ban gaya aur apne bats k dar ko hata diya.,"I feel hes lucky become part of the league of shadows, and to purge his fear of bats. this key part I think is pretty lucky break for him. as he is doing jail time in a foreign country."
Ye kaafi strange hai k uski family butler afford kar sakti hai but wo jail chor karne k liye jata hai,It is strange that his family could afford a butler but he goes to prison for stealing...

"haan, puri movie mein kafi points par aisa laga ki kafi character ke liye it was over","It appeared to be over for many characters in this movie at different points, yeah."
main bhi surprised tha jab asli Ra's al Ghul ne khud ko dikhaya.  League of Shadows asaani se nahi marta,"I was surprised when the real Ra's al Ghul showed himself, too. The League of Shadows doesn't die easily."

I wonder Rotten Tomatoes score aur Metacritic score me Wonder Woman k liye itna gap kyu hai,I wonder why there is a gap in the Rotton Tomatoes score and the Metacritic score for Wonder Woman
"hello! ye kaafi strange hai, maybe unki different audience hai, kya tumne originally ise war movie type se dekha? I guess personally main war movies aur super hero movies ko seperate karta hu.","hello! that is very strange, maybe they have different audiences, did you originally see this as a war movie? I guess i personally separate war movies from super hero movies"
"main bhi wahi karta hu. Main dono ko alag genre maanta hu , bhale hi Wonder Woman World War 1 k duaran set thi.","I do that too, I think of them both as different genres, even though Wonder Woman was set during World War 1."
"Haan, main unhen ek saath samoohabaddh karate hue dekh sakata tha, main aamataur par unhen alag karata hoon, main actors ka aanand leta hoon haalaanki, gal gadot aur chris pine mahaan hain, aapako unakee pasand ke baare mein kaisa laga?","Yeah I could see them grouping it together, I just usually separate them, I enjoy the actors though, Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are great, how did you feel about their choices?"
"Mujhe laga ki kaasting bahut achchhee thee, haalaanki yah pahalee baar tha jab mainne gal gadot ke baare mein suna.","I thought the casting was great, even though this was the first time I ever heard of Gal Gadot."
"Haalaanki main hairaan tha ki yah ek dc movie haaha ko dekhate hue sirtiks ke saath bahut achchhee tarah se praapt hua tha, aamataur par marvel jagah chalaata hai","I was shocked though it was so well received with cirtics considering its a DC film haha, usually Marvel runs the place"
Main sahamat hoon. mujhe lagata hai ki isaka ek kaaran yah tha ki ise achchhee tarah se praapt kiya gaya tha kyonki wonder woman badhate sangharsh mein yogadaan dene ke bajaay yuddh ko samaapt karane kee koshish kar rahee thee.,"I agree. I think one of the reasons it was well received was because Wonder Woman was trying to end the war, instead of contributing to a growing conflict."
"Haan, bahut see marvel movies sirph ek sangharsh karane ke lie hotee hain aur phir ek maujooda band hone ke bajaay isake saath jaatee hain. mainne haalaanki isaka aanand liya, haalaanki yah raay mein antar dilachasp hai, mujhe nahin pata ki kya main ek doosare ko dekhoonga","yeah, a lot of the marvel movies tend to just make up a conflict and then go with it instead of going off an existing one. I enjoyed it though, It is interesting the difference in opinions though, I don't know if I would see a second one "
"mujhe lagata hai ki agar patty jenkins ek seekval ka nirdeshan karatee hai, to yah pahale vaale kee tarah achchha hoga iss movie ke saath unhonne bahut achchha kaam kiya.","I think if Patty Jenkins directs a sequel, it would be as good as the first one. She did a great job with this movie."
"Yah sach hai, agar ve kalaakaaron aur chaalak dal ko ek saath rakh sakate hain to mujhe lagata hai ki yah ek hit virddhi kee sambhaavana hai. mera maanana ​​hai ki 3 se adhik eksachenjon ke baad ab hamane movie ke baare mein socha hai","thats true, if they can keep the cast and crew together I think the chances of it being a hit increase. I believe thats more then 3 exchanges we've had about the movie now"
"Dastaavez sirph mere lie apadet kiya gaya. movie kee meree nazar mein aane vaalee cheejon mein se ek yah hai ki samay avadhi ko kaise chitrit kiya gaya tha, khaasakar Princess Diana ko photographic plet kaise milee, jabaki ab ham selphee le sakate hain. yah ek dilachasp disconnect hai.","The document just updated for me. One of the things that caught my eye of the movie is how the time period was depicted, especially with how Princess Diana received a photographic plate whereas now we can take selfies. It is an interesting disconnect."
"Oh mera bhee adyatan kiya gaya, is baare mein kshama karen. mujhe lagata hai ki movie kelie dilachasp aur ek achchhee avadhi hai, mujhe lagata hai ki isake peechhe shaamil pauraanik katha bahut pecheeda thee","Oh mine just updated too, sorry about that. I think thats interesting and a good period for the film, I think the mythology involved behind it was very intriguing "
"Main sahamat hoon. aamataur par jab bhee kisee philm mein greek ya roman pauraanik kathaon ko prastut kiya jaata hai to vah ghanee aur apaaradarshee hotee hai, lekin wonder woman mein yah aasaanee se samajh mein aa gaya.","I agree. Usually whenever Greek or Roman mythology is presented in a movie it is dense and opaque, but it was easily understood in Wonder Woman."
"haan, is tarah kee avadhaaranaon ko pesh karana nishchit roop se kabhee-kabhee paalan karane ke lie kathin ho sakata hai ki ve kaise prastut karate hain. yah dilachasp hai ki zoo ne maanav jaati kee raksha ke lie amejan yoddhaon ko chuna",Yeah introducing concepts like that can definitely be hard to follow sometimes depending on how they're presented. It's interesting that zues chose amazonian warriors to protect mankind
"jis tarah se eres ko dandit kiya gaya tha vah bhee dilachasp tha, keval zeus ne use ladaee mein ghaayal karane mein saksham kiya.","The way Ares was punished was also interesting, with only Zeus able to wound him in the battle."
"mujhe yah pasand aaya ki yah keval vaam, zeus aur eres ko maanav jaati ko bachaane ke lie ladana tha, isane ise us samay ke saath dilachasp bana diya jahaan itihaas mein pahalee baar hamane vishv yuddh kiya tha","I liked that it was only them left, zues and ares had to fight to save mankind, it made it interesting with it being in a time period where the first time in history we had a world war"
"mujhe laga ki yah dilachasp tha ki american chalak dakshin american ke paas durghatanaagrast ho gaya, pratham vishv yuddh ko amozon se jodakar meree raay mein philm mein bahut achchha kaam kiya gaya.","I thought it was interesting that the American pilot crashed near south America, connecting World War 1 to the Amazonian setting was done very well in the film in my opinion."
"haan, aisa lagata hai ki unhonne vaastavik duniya kee sthitiyon se jude kathaanak binduon ko jodane ka ek bahut achchha kaam kiya hai, is dveep par phir se jangalon dvaara aakraman kiya ja raha hai taaki unakee yuddh takaneek ko aage badhaaya ja sake aur aapako vaastav mein achchhe paksh / bure paksh ka ehasaas ho.","yeah it seems they did a very good job of having the plot points connect with real world situations, the island then being invaded by the germans looking to advance their warfare technology really gives you a sense of good side/bad side"
"vishesh roop se germans ke paas raasaayanik hathiyaaron ke ek bhee ghaatak sanskaran ko injeeniyar karane kee koshish kar raha tha, mujhe lagata hai ki har kisee kee nirbaadh mrtyu dar mein bahut achchha sambandh ha","Especially with the Germans trying to engineer an even deadlier version of the chemical weapons they had, I think that ties very well into everyone's ingrained mortality. "
"mujhe yah bhee pasand hai ki hippolyta ne apanee bahan ko daayana ko prashikshit karane kee anumati dee thee, jisase use vah atirikt dene kee jaroorat thee jo vaastav mein amaajoniyan yoddhaon se baahar khade hone kee jaroorat thee","I also like that Hippolyta allowed her sister to train Diana, giving her the extra she needed to really stand out from the amazonian warriors "
"mujhe laga ki yah ek bahut hee naareevaadee-prerit drshy tha, jise philm mein dekhakar mujhe bahut maja aaya. yah ek bada gatisheel tha ki kaise vishv yuddh lagabhag vishesh roop se purushon dvaara lada gaya tha, ekamaatr mahila jo ise samaapt karana chaahatee thee","I felt that was a very feminist-inspired scene, which I really enjoyed seeing in the film. That was a big dynamic in how the World War was almost exclusively fought by men, with the sole woman wanting to end it."
"yah vaastav mein ek dilachasp bindu hai jis par mainne vichaar nahin kiya hai, mujhe pata hai ki philm ko vyaapak roop se naareevaad ko ek aavaaj dene ke lie ghoshit kiya gaya tha lekin yah bindu vaastav mein thos hai","that is a really interesting point that I haven't considered, I know that the film was widely proclaimed to give a voice to feminism but that point really solidifys that"
"mujhe vaastav mein sar patrick se ares kee ummeed nahin thee, yah ek dilachasp gatisheel hai jo vaastav mein saamane aaya hai.","I really didnt except Sir Patrick to Ares, its an interesting dynamic that really came out. "
"maine socha jis scene main Sir Patrick reveal kiya kyonki Ares ne bi influence kiya tha, jahan woh Godkiller sword ko use karke humanity ko destroy karna chatha tha, lekin Wonder woman ne no kah diya.","I thought the scene when Sir Patrick revealed himself as Ares also influenced that, where he wanted to use the Godkiller sword to destroy humanity, but Wonder Woman said no."
yeah main really expect nahin kiya wonder woman hi godkiller thi although isme koi sense nahin hai,yeah I really didn't except wonder women to be the godkiller although it does make sense
"i think woh ek bada feminist point hai movie hai, mere opinion hai.movie ka ending bahut heartfelt tha aur connect kiya ki kaise past wars hamare present ko influence karte hain princess diana ne email kiya bruce wayne ko","I think that was another big feminist point in the movie, in my opinion. The ending of the movie was very heartfelt and connected how wars of the past influence our present when Princess Diana emailed Bruce Wayne"
"haan, mujhe lagta hai characters ki dynamics acchi fit karti hai, sabhi ko link karte hue, diana aur bruce se lekar, diana aur ares thak aur ares aur zues","yeah, I think the dynamic between the all the characters fits really well, linking it all togheter, from diana and bruce, to diana and ares, and ares and zues"
"casting ne help kia movie ko incredible banane ke liye, charisma aur chemistry ke andar character dikhta hai.jo scene jahan steve ne bomber ko hijack kiya acchi tarah dikhta hai.","The casting helped make the movie incredible, the charisma and chemistry between every character showed. The scene where Steve hijacked the bomber showed that very well I think."
"steve ka bhi accha interesting role hai movie mein, bahut support deta hai lekin phir bhi main role nahi leta","Steve has a really inteseting role in the movie too, providing a lot of support but still not taking over the main role "
uska charcter excellent supporting charcter hai mere khayal se.,His character was an excellent supporting character in my opinion.
Hi! Apko 1990 ki comedy Home Alone kaisi lagi?,Hi! So what did you think of the 1990 comedy Home Alone?
Hello. Mujhe acchi lagi. Mujhe Joe Pesci ko aisi interesting aur hilarious movie me dekh ke accha laga kyuki maine unhe jyadatar serious movies me hi dekha hai.,Hello. I like it. It's very interesting and hilarious to me seeing Joe Pesci in a movie like this since I know him form the more serious movies he did.
Sahi kha! Usne Harry ka role bohot accha nibhaya. Sabhi actors ne accha kam kiya! Kya wah apke favorite the film me?,Very true! He nailed the role of Harry! All of the actors did! Was he your favorite actor in the film?
Is movie me Macaulay Culkin mere favorite the. Unko 2 adults ko outsmart karte dekh bahut maza aaya.,Macaulay Culkin is my favorite in the movie. It was so fun just watching him outsmart 2 grown men.
"Agreed! Vah mere bhi favorite the! CinemaScore ke rating A se main bilkul agree karta hu, mai bhi is film ko yahi ratings dunga.",Agreed! He was my favorite as well! I can't help but agree with CinemaScore's rating of A as that would be the rating I'd give the film as well!
"Yes, yah ek christmas classic hai aur A rating ke layak hai. Mujhe lagta hai ki jo critics is movie ko iske implausible plot ke liye criticize karte hai woh is movie ko kuchh jyada hi seriously le rahe hai, creators ka irada serious movie banane ka nahi tha.",Yes this is a christmas classic and deserves an A rating. I feel the critic that described the movie as having an implausible plot is taking the movie more seriously than the creators of the movie intended it to be.
"Sahi kaha! Kuchh critics pagal ho gaye hain. Khash kar woh jiska apne description diya aur woh jisne first half ko ""flat aur unsurprising"" bataya.","Very well said! Some of the critics were out of their minds. Especially the one you described as well as the one who called the first half ""flat and unsurprising""."
"Han, muje first half bada entertaining laga. Maine ye movie little wow me nahi dekhi, main shayad jaunga aur dekhunga.",Yes I found the first half very entertaining. I haven't seen this movie in a little wow I might go back and watch it
Main apko feel kar sakta hu. Yakin nahin hota ki yeh movie 1990 me release huyi thi.,I feel you! So hard to believe it was released in 1990! 
"Mujhe  ""sadistic festival of adult-bashing"" yah quote achha lagta hai. Kevin ke parents ka use bhulna aur burglars ke bich yah movie adults ko bahut accha nahi deikhati.","I like the quote ""sadistic festival of adult-bashing"". Between's Kevin's parents forgetting him and the burglars this movie doesn't make adult looks too bright."
yeh tho sach hein! ha! Pesci aur Stern tho acting ka badiya job kiya voh tho adults ka part bhi kiya jo itna bhi bright nahi tha! john Hughes ne is movie ko perfectly write kiya hein,That is true! Ha! Pesci and Stern did a great job acting the part as adults who weren't very bright! John Hughes wrote the movie perfectly!
mein tho us kevin character ko relate kar raha hun voh tho fun hein uska family aur kids tho ache tarah deal kar raha tha. is part ka movie tho hamesha soft spot mein hi hit hota.,I related to the character Kevin being made fun of  by his family since kids deal with that all the time. The part of the movie always always hits a soft spot for me.
"yaha bhi! muje honestly kevin ke liye bura laga kyon ki pehele baar use dekha tho ridiculed mein uska siblings yaani cousins tho uska picha chod diya. aapke tarah, tho mein us ridicule ka aspect se relate kar raha tha","Same here! I honestly felt bad for Kevin at first seeing as how he was ridiculed by his siblings/cousins before being left behind. Like you, i could relate as well to the ridicule aspect of it."
muje tho acharya laga ki voh kevin ka dad se work kar raha hein aur voh fly karne ka afford nahi kar saka tho kaafi people paris jaathe christmas ke liye. mein tho usse hi blame karunga,I wonder what kind of job Kevin's dad worked that he could afford to fly that many people to Paris for christmas. I blame him for all of this!
voh tho sach hein! aur uska pura family tho us night mein departure ho gaye hein,That is true! And plus they housed the entire family the night before their departure.
pura human being ke liye kitna rush karenge. mein tho koi McCallister ka family bird hota tho mein guess nahi kiya.  alarms tho nahi exist hien,How much of rush do you have to be in to forget a whole human being. I guess nobody in the McCallister family was an early bird either. Alarms didn't always exist.
are kidding mat karna! mein bhi yeh sab wonder kartha! jab tak koi realize nahi hote tab kate ko koi flight mein nahi hein kar ke. yeh tho awful hein,No kidding! I wonder that as well! Then they don't even realize he's missing until Kate discovered it during the middle of their flight. So awful!
muje tho imagine bhi nahi kar saktha ki yeh sab danger tha mera childhood mein lekin voh tho polka band se hitch hike huva. muje tho us part ko badi funny laga,I couldn't imagine anything other than my child being in danger convincing me to hitch hike with a polka band. I found that part very funny.
yahi bhi- aur voh moving van tho badiya thi. voh tho incredibly hilarious hein,Same here - and in a moving van at that. That was incredibly hilarious!
soch le agar yeh halfway flying mein troble hein aur jab voh holiday ke liye jaa raha hein lekin usko us time ko enjoy nahi kar saka. tho yeh sab ache nahi hein na yeh tho mad ke tarah hein,Imagine going through the trouble of flying halfway across the world for a holiday and not even being able to enjoy your time on the trip. That wouldn't be good at all for me I would be so mad.
"mujhe pata hai, right? Us point par mujhe Kate ke liye sorry feel huya. Aur uske top par, tum sirf Scranton ki flight land kar sakte ho aur jab tum wahan ho, Chicago ki sari flights book thi. Kitna stressful hai!","I know, right? At that point, I felt sorry for Kate as well. Then on top of that, you can only land a flight to Scranton and while there, all flights to Chicago were booked. Talk about stressful!"
Han sure very stressful. I wonder wo family Paris mein Kevin ke uncle ke apartment mein kya think kar rahi hogi.,For sure very stressful. I wonder what the family was thinking back in Paris at the apartment of Kevin's Uncle.
Unki vacation certainly ruin hogayi hogi jab Kevin unke house ko booby traps se rig karne ke process mein tha Harry aur Marv ke liye! Wo scene bhi hilarious tha,Their vacation was certainly ruined while Kevin was in the process of rigging up their house with booby traps for Harry and Marv! That was a hilarious scene as well!
Kevin kid genius tha. mini macgyver ki tarah house ko rig karne mein. Ofcourse Marv aur Harry ko trick hote dekhna funny tha. Thank god Marley Kevin ke hurt hone se pehle wahan pahunch gaya.,Kevin was a kid genius. Rigging up the house like mini macgyver. Of course seeing Marv and Harry get tricked was very funny. Thank god Marley got there before Kevin got hurt.
Tum sahi ho! Thankfully wo wahan time par pahunch gaya aur cops thode time mein Harry aur Marv ko arrest karne aa gaye,You're right! Thankfully he did get there just in time and the cops came shortly after to arrest Harry and Marv!
Muje whole family ko last mein reunite hote dekhkar kafi accha laga. Kevin ka ye realize karna ki wo apni family ko door nahi jane dena chahta bohat touching tha.,I love seeing the whole family reunited at the end. Having Kevin realize he didn't want his family to go away was very touching.
Han wo tha - especially jab wo dekhta hai ki uski family Christmas Day par abhi bhi gayi huyi hai Kate ke ghar mein enter karke bulane se pehle,It was - especially after he sees the family was still gone on Christmas day at first before Kate entered the house calling for him.
Mujhe ye interesting laga ki kisine family ko nahi inform kiya ki jab wo gaye they tab ghar mein kya events huye. Mujhe lagta hai police shayad Kevin ke parents se baat karne mein interested ho.,I do find it a little interesting that no one informed the family about the events that took place while they were gone. I would figure the police might be interested to talk to Kevin's parents.
"I agree jab Buzz yell karta hai  ""Kevin what did you do to me room?"" wo bohat hilarious tha. Aur end me Kevin bhag jata hai. Mujhe aaj tumse Home Alone discuss karke kafi acha laga.","I agree but it was hilarious when Buzz yelled ""Kevin what did you do to me room?"" and Kevin ran off at the end. I enjoyed discussing Home Alone with you today!"

"Main sehmat huin. Main zara Rotten Tomatoes ke score se disappointed huin. Phir se, yeh pehli baar hai ki Pixar ne ek prequel film bnayi hai.","I agree. I'm slightly disappointed by the Rotten Tomatoes score. Then again, it is the first time that Pixar has made a prequel film. "
Kya aamtaur par Monster's University jaisi movies dekhte ho?,Do you typically watch movies like Monster's University?
Zyadatar nhi main aamtaur par anime movies dekhta huin. Lekin jab main bacha tha to ek hi franchise dwara banayi gayi movies dekhta tha. To main aamtaur par aisi movies dekhne ki koshish krta huin.,Typically no since i generally like to watch anime. But if the franchise is one i watched when i was a kid. Then I usually will make a effort to see it.
Aur main maanata hoon ki voh score thode kam lag rahe hain.,And i agree those scores kinda seem rather low.
"Main samjhta huin. Sirf ratings to dekh kar, tumhe lagta hai ki iss prequel ko dekhne ki koshish krte? Ya score tumhe movie dekhne ke liye discourage krte hai?","I understand. Just by glancing at the ratings, do you think you'd make an effort to go see the prequel? Or would the score discourage you from seeing the film?"
Main isse bure reviews milne ke baad bhi dekhunga. Main zayadtar cheezein khud dekh kar decide krna pasand krta huin ki mujhe pasand hai ya nhi. Jaise agar 99% log kehte hai ki ye buri hai ya achhi. Main aamtaur par baatein sunn kar unke peeche nhi jata. Main bas chala jata huin or khud se experience krta huin. Aur phir main aamtaur par batata huin ke ye badiya hai ya buri.,"Id still see it despite bad reviews. I generally like to decide things by myself to see if i like it or not. Like if 99% of people say its bad or good. I usually won't follow what i hear. I just go and experience it for myself. And then from there I usually say its cool or 
say its bad."
"Samajh mein aata hai. Main jayadatar tab ratings pe dhayan deta huin jab main director ko janta huin. Agar mujhe pata hai ki aamtaur par unka kam bahut shaandaar hai or uss ek movie ke bahut buri ratings, main aamtaur par uspe paise lagane se pehle friends/ family se sunn leta huin.","Makes sense. I typically only pay attention to the ratings when it's a director who I am familiar with. If I know that their work is usually phenomenal and a particular movie has awful ratings, I usually will wait to hear from friends/family before paying to see it. "
Saath hi mein mujhe comedy movies bhi pasand hai. To main shayad memes or jokes enjoy karunga.,Also im a fan of comedy movies. So I'll probably enjoy for the memes and jokes.
Main bhi.,Ya same.
Comedy movies meri book me must see hain,Comedy movies are always a must see in my book. 
"Aur sach bolun to, pixar hamesha achi movies banati hai to mujhe achi expectations hain. Illumination movies keliye main thoda ""iffy"" hun.","And if im being honest, pixar usually makes good movies so I have good expectations. Illumination movies is what im ""
iffy"" about."
mujhe acha laga ki Monster's University me fraternity involved thi. Aur bhi zyada kyunki wo isey Roar Omega Roar bulaate hain.,I love that Monster's University has a fraternity involved. Even more so love it because they call it Roar Omega Roar.
Mike 7 hai???? Kya..mujhe ye bilkul nahi pata tha,Mike is 7???? What in the...I never knew that.
han wo name bhadiya hai,ya that name is great.
Wo sirf seven tha jab wo field trip pe jata hai. Wo gyarah saal bad college ko jata ha. To wo ab attharah ka hoga.,He's only seven when he goes on the field trip. He goes to college eleven years later. So he'd be eighteen.
maine bhi ye pehle misread kiya,I misread that at first too. 
ahhh mujhe lagta hai ye sab clear kar deta hai,ahhh I see well that clears that up.
lagta hai ye movie kafi heavily cartoon fraternities par based hai.,Looks like this movie is pretty heavily based on cartoon fraternities. 
yep,yep
"muje thoda odd laga, is movie mein pixar ke liye yek scene hein, jaha sulley tampers with the machine ne better score kiya... aajkal ka demographic mein fairplay ne promote nahi kiya",I find it odd that Pixar has a scene in this movie where Sulley tampers with the machine to get better scores. Doesn't really promote the whole 'fair play' imagine to their age demographic. 
oozma kappa. muje nahi lagtha koi kappa ka meme banega,Oozma Kappa. I can't believe they threw a kappa meme in there.
har movie mein kappa ka fraternity/ sorority banaya. kya aap notice nahi kiya,Every movie with a fraternity/sorority always contains 'Kappa.' Ever notice that?
haan.. pretty dead meme tha,ya. Its pretty much a dead meme.
"kya mein slow hoon, harscrabble yek male ko think karne mein",Am i slow for thinking hardscrabble was male until this passage? lol
"cda tho is movie ke liye stands kiye... clearly, kuch enforcer form kare aur monster ke paas kis taray ka enforcer hein","Wonder what CDA stands for in this movie. Clearly, it's some form of an enforcer but what type of enforcer does a monster have? "
yeh kuch scary ke tarh bhi ho sakthe,idk maybe to make sure they are scary enough.
"nahi, muje bhi aise hi kuch lagtha,.. kyon ki is mein kuch gender context nahi hein",Nope! I thought the same. I think it was because there was no gender context to go off of in the last paragraph. 
haan,yeah probably.
tho yeh kids ke liye tho safe movie hein,Well it sounds like a safe movie for the kids.
"nahi, muje nahi lagtha yeh itna bhi scary hoga... CDA ne cop ko form kiya aur usse campus se expulsion karne ke liye university aathe","No, I don't think it's to make sure they're scary enough... the CDA has to be some form of a cop as they are removing them off campus due to their expulsion from the university. "
thoda hidden adult jokes hein us college aur fraternity ne tho yek ya do slip jarur liya hoga,"Although i
 expect a few hidden adult jokes cause college and fraternity makes me think they slip one or two in there."
"ah, ab hui na baath",Ah i see that would make sense.
"mein maantha hoon.. us cheating portion is movie mein jo skeptical hein, lekin kids film ke liye tho bilkul coincide nahi huva... is saal ke bachon ko kya sikhane chathe yeh tho pura negative reinforces hein us monsters ka action ka","I agree. I was skeptical about the cheating portion of the movie as that doesn't coincide
 with a kids film and what you'd want to teach the kids at this age level but they do bring in negative reinforcers for the monster's actions,. "
"sach.. in dinno mein movies tho itna formulaic tropes hein, jo kids ko nahi dekha sakthe",True. Movies these days are getting so caught up in formulaic tropes that kids pick up on them.
movies tho fresh aur unpredictable honna mera hope hein,I hope the movie stays fresh and a bit unpredictable.
kids ko tho hum hamare toes mein rakhna chahiye,Keep the kids on their toes.
har kisi ka hope hein,One can only hope. 
"smart bhi rehena chahiye, jo parents bhi enjoy kar sakthe",And still be smart enough to let the parents enjoy it.
"79% kids movie tho bad hi hota mera opinion se, keyscenes ko badne ke baath",A 79% on a kids movie doesn't seem too bad in my opinion after reading the key scenes.
"ISLIYE PIXAR KA PURANE FILMS ACHA RAHATE, MERA KHAYAL SE.... AUR AAJ BHI IS MOVIES BETTER HEY",Thats why past pixar films in my opinion were so good. And still seem better than movies today.
YEH THO SACH HEIN... OVERALL YEH KUCH ACHE MOVIE SOUNDS KARTHA,Thats true. I think overall it sounds like a good movie.
namaste,hi

agar voh aur thoda famous logo ko use kar sakthe they,I wish they would have used more famous people. 
"mein bhi maantha hoon, ki voh ache nahi hein us man of steel ke tarah.. plot line tho amazing hein",I would agree though that it was not as good as man of steel. The plot line of that was amazing!
sirf ben affleck hi yek actor jo ache tarah recognize kiya jo harsh critcs se,Ben Affleck is the only actor I recognize great plot very harsh critcs
mein maantha hoon... muje yeh understand nahi hota ki kyon batman aur superman aapas mein fight karthe,I agree. I didn't completely understand why Batman and Superman fought though. 
"rotten tomatoes neh 27% di aur uska average tho 4.9/10 tha... critics tho weird hein... haan, muje bhi is fight ko figure out nahi kar paa raha hoon, lekin kuch samaj aarahi hein ki kyonki superman ko acceidentally bruce wayne ka dad maar daala",Rotten Tomatoes list it as 27%and average with a 4.9 out of 10. The critcs must be weird. Yeah i couldnt figure out the fight but think it was because superman accidentally killed bruce waynes dad
muje laga ki yeh worth meteroitic score 44 ke se upper hein.. lekin low nikla.. mein tho mad hota agar koi mera family ko aise koi maar dethe,I thought it was worth a meteoritic score more than 44. That seemed low! That makes sense. I would be mad if someone tried to kill one of my family members. 
hello,hello?
"yeh tho unique spin hey lex luthor ka character ko jo whole movies mein nazar aathe.. muje tho unka bol pasand hein, jaise critic ko lex ke saath bola kyon ki dono aapas me compared kar rahe the ki kon joker aur riddler hein",Yeah me to it did also have a unique spin on character of Lex Luthor who just seems to go doown hill the whole movie. I like how the critic talked about Lex (who is supermans arch enemy ) because he compared him to the joker and riddler (who are batmans arch enemies
fir donon compare karthe karthe crazy hote aur mark zuckerburg tak pahun jaathe,Then he tops off the crazy part by comparing him to Mark Zuckerburg. 
acha.. muje bhi pasand hein.. muje tho voh pasand hein jab government official ko yaha laane ke try kar rahe they,Ohh. I liked that too. I like how they always try to biring in the government official s

mai 70 aur 80s ke justice league cartoon ko dekthey huye bada huva hun jis mai sabhi superheros sath me kaam karthe the,I grew up watching the justice league cartoons in thelate 70s and early 80s in which alll the superheros worked together.

haan wo mysterious hai,Yes he is very mysterious
ye hai.  jo maine expect kiya tha who ye nahi hai,It is. Its not what I expected at all
main ise kuch avengers ke jaise expect kiya that jis may kuch heroes saath mai kaam karthe hai,I expected more like the avengers where a bunch of heroes work together 
way dusman hai ye mujhe bilkul pasand nahi hain,I don't really like that they are enimies
khas kar ke jab batman superman ko marne wala tha,Especially to the point where batman was going to kill superman 
"main bhi but superman ne ye starty kiya, article me clark kent bruce wayna aur batman ko bura dikhane ki koshish kar raha hai",Me either but superman pretty much started it the article says clark kent was trying to make bruce wayne and batman look bad thru his news articles
tum jaante ho to be honest agar duniya ko aise dekhoge jaise abhi hai to unka dushman hona makes perfect sense,You know though to be honest if you look at the way the world is today so full of bad it makesperfect sense in a world view to have them as enemies. 
I guess so. Unki bilkul polar opposite personalities hai. Ek to humble farm boy hai dusra ek rich executive,I guess so. They do have polar opposite personalities. One is a humble farm boy and the other is a rich executive 
Main dekh sakta hu ke us aspect me kyu clash karege but main superhero world me jyada interact karte hue imagine nahi karta.,"I could see why they clash in that aspect, but I guess I don't imagine them interacting very much in superhero world. "
Aisa bolte hai ke 3rd part me superman ke funeral k dauran bruce lois lane se maafi mangta hai ye bolte hue k he failed superman,It says in the 3rd part that at supermans funeral that bruce way e apol9gizes to lois lane saying that he failed superman
DUHHHHH well han agar tumne use maar diya matlab you failed him lol,DUUHHHH well yeah he failed him if he killed him lol
"Mujhe bhi aisa lagega k I failed someone agar maine unhe marne diya. haha, mujhe dhool ka  mysterious levitate karna accha laga",I would feel like if I failed someone if I let them die too. Haha. I like the mysterious dirt levitating though 
Haha,Haha 
Main bhi yahi soch raha hai,Thats what I was thinking 
Thoda humor waha,Little humor there

Haan maine teen baar dekhi its a tearjerker for me jab superman marta hai,Yes watched it 3 times its a tearjerker for me when superman dies
Mujhe lagta hai acchi superhero movies ke sequel hone chahiye,I feel like good superhero movies need sequels 
Could be a sequel pata nahi mujhe,I dunno could be a sequel 
Jaise superman asliyat mein mara nahi tha usne bas hibernate kiya tha til he found out a way to smooth it over with batman,Like how superman didnt really die he just hibernated til he found out a way to smooth it over with batman
