oye ledki kitni mazakiya movie dekh rhi ho ?,ah mean girls. such a funny movie. have you seen it? 
ha muje bhi hassi mazak ki movies pasand par ye meri pehli favorite nhi hai,"Yeah, even though I love comedies, this wasn't 1 of my faves"
kese tina ka jhuti writing isme achi the usne ek self help book ko adbhut kaam kiya,how come. thought tina fey's writing was fantastic in it. she did an amazing job adapting a self help book
muje kahani bhute achi lagi aur unhone ise dach kar diya ki kaise teen girls acting kerti hai lekin mai imandari se nhi janti ki maine ise kyu rate nhi kiya kyuki sab kuch sahi tha mai vishvas nhi ker skta ki ye 2004 tha halaki ise 14 sall pehle released kiya tha,"I loved the story & how true they made it in how  teen girls act but I honestly don't know why I didn't rate it highly as all the right ingredients were there. I cannot believe it was 2004 it was released though, 14 years ago!"
ab samja muje nhi pta tha ki aap sahi admi hai ab mai budha hone lga hu muje theaters mai yad hai ki ap mujse ashemat the ki yeh 50 teen hasya mai se ek hai kam se kam sade tamatar ke hisab se,"I see. i didn't realize it was 14 years ago. you're right. Man. now I feel old. i remember seeing this in the theaters. i guess you disagree that it's one of top 50 teen comedies, at least according to rotten 
tomatoes"
muje lgta hai ki yeh kewal personal pasand ke bare mai hai meri pasandida american comedy films Will Ferrol or Seth Rogan ke sath kuch bhi samil slapstick films hai muje yakin hai ki ek film thi jisme Lindsay Lohan ko bhot bada bna diya tha bhale hi usne apne surati saalo mai movies mai acting ki thi,"I suppose it's just all about personal preference, my favourite American comedy films include anything with Will Ferrol & Seth Rogan so more slapstick films. I'm sure this was the movie that made Lindsay Lohan huge even though she had starred in m
ovies from her early years"
yeh Lindsay Lohan ki badi safaltao mai se ek hai isse wo pehchane lgi hai halaki muje lagta hai Amanda Seyfried bhi achi tra film mai janne lgi hai wo iss film mai bhote sundar tha muje unka prasansak bna diya hai,This was one of lindsay lohan's bigger successes. it made her very well known. although i think it made amanda seyfried well known too. she was so pretty in this film. it made a fan out of me.
waise muje khushi hai ki yeh utna bada tha jitna yeh message the ki teen girls ke liye jo umeed se kuch logo ke madhyam se mile kyuki high school ke din iss baat ki chinta kerne ke liye kafi tanavpurne hai ki aap ek click kyu nhi acha hai kuch alag hai,Well I'm glad it was as big as it was as the message it sent out to teenage girls hopefully got through to some because high school days are stressful enough to be worrying about why you are/aren't in a clique. It's good to be different!
jarur. yehi self help book ki baat hai. ledkiyo ke liye high school bhute kathin ho skta hai aur fil us par light dalti hai aur ek hi samay mai yeh bewakuftapurn apne app pariksha mai badal jati hai ki bache kis tra pariksha dete hai. yeh ek adhar ke bine nhi hai ki rolling stone ko comic gold kha jata hai,sure. That's the point of the self help book. For girls high school can be pretty tough and the movie makes it light of that andat the same time turns it into silly self examination of how kids behave. it's not without a basis that rolling stones called a comic gold. 
mai abhi bhi jivan mai use pressure wale samay ko yad kerta hu aur wah ek lamba samay tha halaki mere beti lagbahg 13 saal ki haimai yeh sure rehne ki kosis kerta hu ki use self confidencehai ki wah bhide mai nhi grow ker rhi hai kyuki teen girls ko jo nuksan ho skta hai wha bhote seriuos baat hai,I can still remember the pressure of that stage in life and it was a long time ago although my daughter is nearly 13 so I;m trying to make sure she has the self confidence to not feel the need to follow the in crowd as the damage it can do to teenage girls can be very serious
Ye funny hai ke character ko home school hona pada kyuki uske parents africa me zoologists the. No wonder movie k beginning me clicks k upar educated hona pada.,"it's funny how the character was home schooled because her parents were zoologists working in africa. no wonder she had to be educated on the clicks in the beginning
 of the movie. "
"Ye home schooling ko bahut appealing banata hai. I love kaise 'mean girls' jo plastic naam se known the, sab fake the.","Makes hoe schooling very appealing. I love how the 'mean girls' are known as the plastics, all fake"
"Haan, ye Tina Fey ki genius writing kar part hai. Mere opinion me wo hamare time ke sabse talented comedians me se ek hai.","yeah, that's the part of genius writing on tina fey's part. she's really one of the most talented comedians of our time, in my opinion"
Bahut clever lady. Ye baaki sabhi american teen movies se stand out karti hai jo us time popular thi.,Very clever woman. It def stood out from all the other American teen movies that were so popular around that time
Haan. Jyadatar teen comedies slap stick type hoti hai. Ye bahut jyada cerebral thi. I wonder ki jis actress ne regina play kiya koi aur movies kar k nahi. Wo us movie me fantastic thi.,"yeah. more often than not, teen comedies tend to be slap stick type. this was a lot more cerebral. i wonder if the actress who played regina did any more movies. she was fantastic in the movie "
Director Mark Waters k sath bhi same baat. Main uski directed aur koi movies k baare me nahi soch para but surely usne aur movies banai hogi.,"Same with the director, Mark Waters. I cannot think of any other movies he directed but surely he must have made more successful films"
Haan uski koi aur movie nahi recall kar pa raha. Waise Amanda Seyfried ne mean girls k baad kaafi theek kaam kiya hai.,yeah can't recall any of his other movies. amanda seyfried did pretty well after the mean girls though 
Aisa bahut nahi hota k CinemaScore kisi movie ko A deta hai aur main glad hu usne diya because usse bahut positive message jata hai.,It;s not very often a movie gets a CinemaScore A and I'm glad it did as it sent out a very positive message
Main usually ye scores ko jyada trust nahi karta. Main viewer ratings ko critics ratings k bajay jyaada manta hu. Logo ka critics se better taste hota hai.,I usually don't trust those scores so much. i tend to go with viewer ratings instead of critics ratings. people have better tastes than critics. 
"Haan I agree, Rotten Tomatoes k baare me especially. Main pahle aise kaafi movies enjoy kiya hu jinke agar reviews padh leta to put off hojata aur shyad ek acchi movie pe miss out kar jata.","Yeah I agree especially about Rotten Tomatoes, I've really enjoyed movies before that if having read the reviews beforehand would have maybe put me off & resulted in me missing a good movie!"
"haan aur crtics ka ek snob appeal hota hai.unko artsy movies accha lagta hai, although utna entertaining nahin hotahai.personally main entertained hona chahta hoon.muche kuch snobbish movies pasand hai, phir bhi","yeah and critics have certain snob appeal. they tend to like movies that are artsy, although it's not all that entertaining. personally i prefer to be entertained. i mean i like some snobbish movies, but still"
main jarroor interested hoon ye janne ke liye ki ye film kitne number pe aya top 50 result pe teen comedies mein,I'm really interested to find out the where exactly this film came within the top 50 result of teen comedies
"huh, accha savaal hai. mujhe bhi nahin maloom.mujhe lagta hai oopar top 10 main.",huh. that's a good question. i don't know that either. i'd say pretty high probably in the top 10. 
hello tum ho yaahan?,hello you there? 
main jald hi oatha karta hoon lol.mera guess hai American Pie no 1 hai...mujhe irony of Cady bahut accha laga jab plastic  crown ko end mein break kiya,I will be finding out soon lol. I am going to guess that American Pie being no1.. I love the irony of Cady breaking the plastic crown at the end 
american pie ek classic slap stick teen comedy hai.aur woh accha tha.anyway.itna hi mujhse,american pie is the classic slap stick teen comedy. and it was good. anyway. that's all for me 
"yeah mujhe bhi, bahut accha laga tum se baat karke.Take care:)","Yeah me too, was great talking to you. Take care :)"

Wo amazing hai,She was amazing.
Tumhe lagega usne wo role embrace kar liya,You really felt that she embraced that role.
Main admit karunga usne aacha kaam kiya. Wo hamesha role k liye bahut chhoti lagti thi. Maybe main just 70's k TV show se compare kar raha hu.,I will admit she did a good job. She always seemed.... too small for the role. Maybe I'm just comparing it to the 70's TV show.
Main sochta hu ke wo forever Wonder Woman ke naam se jaani jayegi. Like Christopher Reeves Superman k naam se jana jata hai,I think she would be forever remember as wonder woman. As Christopher Reeves  will be Superman.
Wo role k liye chhoti lag rahi thi but bahut badhiya play kiya,She did seem small for the role but she knocked it out the park.
70s k show abhi k shows k comparison me kaafi different hai,70 shows compared to shows now are very different

Yeh eak abinethri aur sangeethkar ke bare main hai.,It's about a actress and a musician.
vo apane sapane ko poora karate hue LA mein milate hain aur pyaar mein pad jaate hain,they meet and fall in love in LA while pursing their dreams
mujhe lagata hai ki yah kuchh aisa dekina hai. sifaarish ke lie shukriya!,It sounds like something I would watch. Than you for the recommendation!
"Haan, isamenbahut saare drshyon ka ek samooh hai jahaan dononkaaphee kanekt nahin karate hain.","Yeah, it has a bunch of great scenes where the two don't quite connect "
"ek ladakee kee tarah, jahaan miya ne ladake kee baat sunee, sebastiyan ne ek baar mein piyaano bajaaya, lekin usane use brash kar diya","like one where the girl, Mia hears the boy,  Sebastian playing the piano
 in a bar but he brushes her off "
phir ve kaise pyaar mein pad jaate hain?,How do they fall in love then?
achchhee tarah se ve ek paartee mein doosaree baar milate hain aur saib ek 80 ka kavar baind mein hai. unake pass yah rasaayan hai jise anadekha kiya jaata hai aur ve thodee der ke lie apane jeevan ke saath chalate hain.,Well they meet for a second time at a party and Seb is in a 80's cover band. They have this chemistry that is ignored and they go on with their lives for a while
phir ve dheere-dheere kuchh taareekhon ke dauraan ek-doosare ke lie girane lagate hain.,Then they slowly start falling for each other over the course of a few dates
Emma stone  aur Rayaan gosaling pramukh bhoomika nibhaate hain.,Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling play the leads
"mujhe un donon ke baare mein nishchit nahin tha ki ve shuroo kar sakate hain, unhen aisa nahin lagata tha ki ve ek saath achchhe honge","I wasn't sure about those two to start out with, they just didn't seem like they'd be good together
 "
kya ema aur reyaan ke paas koee any prasiddh abhineta hain?,Are there any other famous actors beside Emma and Ryan?
jon leejend kee ek chhotee see bhoomika hai,John Legend has a small role
kya use gaana aata hai?,Does he get to sing?
ek sa. unakee ema ke saath ek jodee hai. vah khud bhee ek ya do gaane gaata hai,A bit. He has a duet with Emma. He also sings a song or two by himself 
kya philm mein ema aur reyaan achchha gaate hain?,Do Emma and Ryan sing well in the movie?
kya philm mein ema aur reyaan achchha gaate hain?,They weren't the best signers I've ever heard but it wasn't like Le Mes bad
"sebastiyan charitr kashtaprad hai. mera matalab hai ki vah jaaj mein hai aur maan liya jaata hai ki yah mahaan sangeetakaar hai, lekin isake baare mein ek pratispardha hai. vaastav mein ant kee or bhee ek ullekhaneey charitr ko paribhaashit na karen","Sebastian character is sort of annoying. I mean he's into jazz and is suppose to be this great musician
, but is a compete snob about it.  Def not a likable character even towards the end really "
"emma ke charitr ke baare mein, kya vah pasand karane yogy hai?","What about Emma's character, is she likable?"
"vah hai. main is sekshan ka aanand letee hoon, jahaan vah ek mahila sho karane ka prayaas karatee hai aur main is drshy ke dauraan bhaavanaon mein phans gaee. vah itanee behatareen abhinetree hain ki amal itana vishvasaneey hai ki vah kisee dost ke dost kee kahaanee lagatee hai","She is. I enjoy this section where she attempts to do a women show and I was caught up in the emotions during this scene. She's such a great actress that the execution
 is so believable it sounds like a story of a friend of a friend "
"is samay ke dauraan, seebee ko aisa lagata hai. vah jis baind mein hai, use pop sangeet mein saphalata mil rahee hai, lekin kyonki vah ek aisa jaiz pyorist hai, jise vah chhodana chaahata hai","During this time, Seb feels so out of sorts. the band he's in is finding success in pop music but because he's such a jazz pureist, he wants to quit"
"kya ve ise ant mein, ek jode ke roop mein aur apane kariyar mein donon banaate hain?","Do they make it in the end, both as a couple and in their respective careers?"
"vah isalie nahin kyonki vah Mia se bahut pyaar karata hai, vah use garv karana chaahata hai",He doesn't because he loves Mia so much he wants to make her proud
dukh kee baat hai nahin. ve alag ho jaate hain kyonki unake kariyar alag-alag dishaon mein chalate hain. use ek mahatvapoorn naatak yaad aata hai aur vah ghar vaapas chalee jaatee hai,Sadly no. they drift away as their careers go in different directions. He misses an important play and she moves back home
to yah thoda dukh kee baat hai. lekin mujhe lagata hai ki vaastavik jeevan kaisa hota hai.,So it ends a bit sadly then. But I guess that's how real life goes.
"yah ek bada ""galat sthaan galat samay"" hai, jo samaapt hota hai, jo bekaar hai kyonki aap vaastav mein unake lie jad karana shuroo karate hain.","it's a big ""wrong place wrong time"" kind of ending, which sucks because you really start to root for them. "
"haan, mujhe vaastav mein ant pasand aaya, jabaki yah bilkul sahee nahin tha, yah vaastavik tha.","Yeah, I really liked the ending, while it wasn't perfect, it was real"
kuchh aap philmon ke saath jyaadaatar samay nahin milata hai,Something you don't get with movies most of the time
main sahamat hoon,I agree
main jin cheejon ka prashansak nahin tha unamen se ek yah tha ki Mia ke paas vaastav mein koee vikaas nahin tha.,"One of the things I wasn't a fan of was the fact that 
Mia  didn't really have any development. "
KIS SENSE ME?,In what sense?
Career ke hisab se ya vyaktigat roop se?,Career wise or personal like?
"really zayada personal.usme depth nahi he. voh bas ek actress thi, jisne success pane se pahle kai bar try kiya aur kai bar fail hui.","More personal really. She lacked depth. She was just an actress who tried and failed many times then found success
 "
lekin hame ye show nahi kiya gaya ki use kya found kiya jisne uski grow karne aur better actress banane me madad ki.,But we weren't shown how she found the *thing* that helped her grow and become a better actress
tum jo kahna chahte ho voh samajhane ke liye mujhe ise watch karna chahiye tha. fail hone me aur phir se try karne me kitni depth he ye dikhayi diya.,I might have to watch it to see what you mean. I think failing and trying again shows real depth.
Movie bas jump karke usse aage chali gayi.Seb ko bhi adhik growth nahi mili. voh bas Jazz snob par hi khada rah gaya,the movie just jumped forward passed that. Seb didn't have much growth either. He stayed a jazz snob
"thik he, tumhara thanks, bye!",Ok. Thank you. Bye!
i think you should. yeh ek enjoyable watch he jo tumhe sochne par majboor karti he.Bye!,I think you should. it's an enjoyable watch that makes you think. Bye!

Mujhe yaad hai ye movie dekhna jab main bachha tha aur isse bht funny samjhta tha.,I remember seeing this movie as a child and thought it was very funny
Maine yeh film jab bacha tha tab dekhi thi. Mujhe yaad hai  ki ye mazedaar thi.,I also saw the movie as a kid.  I remember it being funny.
Bade ho kar isse dekhna par isse different perspective se dekhte hai,Watching it as an adult now you see it from a different perspective
"Tum ky asamjhte ho jab critics kehte hai ""sadistic festival of adult bashing""? Yeh ek alag prespective hoga, lekin mujhe abhi lagta hai ki ye funny hai, hai na?","what do you think the critic means by saying ""sadistic festival of adult bashing""?   It would be a different perspective, but I still think it would be funny, dont you?"
Maine weh padha or sach mein isse samajh nhi paya. Mujhe yeh abhi bhi funny lagti hai aur isse adult bashing ki tarah nhi dekhta. Tum kya sochte ho?,I read that also and don't really get it either.  I still find it funny and don't see it as adult bashing.  What are your thoughts?
Main isse adult bashing ki tarah nhi dekhta. Shayad main kuch parts bhool gya. But main isse hote hue dekh dekh skta tha. accidents ho jate hai.,I don't see it as adult bashing.  Maybe I forgot some parts.  But I could see it happening. accidents do happen.  
Jab tumhari ek bahut badi si family ho to aisa ho jata hai. Main first critic ke saath agree krta huin ki first half flat hai. Mujhe yaad ki mujhe fuuny banne mein thoda time lagta hai. Sabhi mazakiyan hisse robbers par kiye gye pranks hai.,When you have that big of a family it definitely could happen.  I do agree with the first critic saying the first half is flat.  I remember it taking a bit to become funny.  All the funny parts are the pranks he plays on the robbers
"Han, main sehmat huin! Kya tumhe yaad hai Marley kaun tha? Roberts Blossom ne play kiya tha? Mujhe wo character yaad nhi hai. 4","Yes, I agree!  Do you remember who Marley was? Played by Roberts Blossom?  I don't remember that character.
4"
Kya yeh wahi purana ladka hai jo saath wale ghar mein rehta tha jisse saare bachhe darte the?,Was he the old guy that lived next door that they kids were all freaked out by?  
"Shayad, mujhe woh part achhe se yaad nhi hai.","Maybe, I don't really remember that part. "
kya story side me change ho jati hai,Did the story just change on the side
mujhe nahi lagta meri abhi tak hui hai.,I don't think mine did yet.
Yes hui hai,Yes it did
ok sorry meri lagi ki jaise hui hai but ye to same story hai.,Ok sorry mine looked as though it did but its the same story. 
I think wo description upar jyada lamba hai.,I think the description up top got longer
"I think wo top part hua hai, key scene change ho gaya hai","I think maybe the top part, the key scene changed?"
now ek aur key scene add kar diya.,now another key scene was added.
"Yes ek key scene to add hua hai,Wo scene hisme Kate k realize hota hai ki wah missing and use flight se ghar wapas bhejne ki koshish karti hai.",Yes it added a second key scene.  The one where Kate realizes he is missing and tries to get a flight home
"Dekha maine, Mujhe yaad nahi ki ye kya mom ka naam hai. mujhe phir se dekhni padegi memory refresh karne ke liye.",I see that.  I didn't remember that was the moms name even.  I better rewatch it and refresh my memory. 
"Maine ise kuch salo pahle dekha tha, fun christmas movie hai. Mujhe yaad hai polka band player Gus ka kirdar John Candy ne play kiya tha.",I saw it a few years ago again.  Its a fun Christmas movie.  I remember Gus the polka band player was played by John Candy
is sab se muje is movie ko dekhne man kar raha hein.. kitne log milkar yeh kiya hein? three?,It makes me want to watch it again.  How many did they make?  Three?
muje bhi lagtha hein ki 3 hi hei... lekin mein baaki 2 nahi dekha... usually remakes ache nahi hota,I think you are right that there are 3.  I never saw the other 2.  Usually remakes are not that good.
mein bhi maantha hoon... mein sabhi dekha hoon lekin kuch yaad nahi hey... mein soch raha tha ki last one tho same characters hein lekin mein galath tha..,"I agree.  I think I saw all of them, but I don't remember them that well.  I'm even thinking the last one wasn't the same characters, but I could be wrong. "
plus kitne baar aap apne kid ko aise chodkar jaa sakthe hein.. muje lagtha hein voh aur koi scene ko add kiya hein.. kaise robbers ko pakad liya aur kevin ko kaise apne mom aur family se unite kiya,Plus how many times are you going to leave your kid behind. I see they added another scene.  How the robbers got caught and Kevin reuniting with his mom and family
acha movie hein yar... mein tho imagine bhi nahi kar sakthi uska mom ka feeling ko,That is a good part of the movie.  I can't imagine how the mom felt.  
mein bhi.. voh tho horrible ho jaathi.. kaise jagad rahi thi apni family ko meet karne ke liye usne tho us flight ko hi jagad li aur uske family ke saath mil gayei,I can't either.  She probably felt horrible.  Funny how she fought to get a flight home and didn't want to wait but her family made it back the same exact time.
haan,Yes!  
last seen marley ne tho uska prana neighbor guy nikla... sabhi voh scary thought kar rahe thei lekin voh kevin ko help kar raha tha uska son aur granddaughter se milanae me,By reading the last seen Marley is the old neighbor guy.  Everyone thought he was scary but Kevin helped him reunited with his son and granddaghter
haan yar lekin uska naam kuch yaad nahi aatha.. mera neighbor ka naam bhi marley hein.. lekin voh choti se bachi yeh.. lol,That makes sense.  I just didn't remember that being his name.  I have a neighbor named Marley too.  But she is young and a girl. lol
merako tho bas itna hi yaad hein ki voh usse oldman marley bula rahe they aur koi kiseko maar diyea au buried bhi... voh hamesha outside hi shoveling kartha aur garbage can apne aapas mein hi raktha,I just remembered they called him Old Man Marley and thought he killed someone and buried him.  He was always outside shoveling and had a garbage can with him. 
Mujhe kaise pata chalega task complete hai,How do we know when this task is complete?
Funny. Looks kaise deceiving ho sakte hain iska ye good message hai. Aur mujhe nahi pata. Kya hum bootom wale finish conversation button ko hit karein? Ya fir jab ham finish kar lenge hame direct kiya jayega?,Funny.  Good message of how looks can be deceiving.    And I don't know.  Do we hit the finish conversation button at the bottom?  Or will be direct us when finished?
"m turk par it says ki ye twenty minutes lega. 30 ho chuke hain. Ye bolta hai ki 12 times talk karna padega, jo mujhe sure hai maine kiya.","On the m turk it says will take about twenty minutes.  It is going on 30.  It says you have to talk 12 times, which I am sure we did"
Ye sahi hai. Maine just dekha mere document ke top par ye kehta hai ki ye document ka end hai aur ab finish conversation button ko click kar sakte hain. Maine instruction wapas dekhe aur ye dekha tha. Mujhe lagta hai hum sahi hain aur finish click kar sakte hain. Thank you.,That is true.  I just saw at the top of my document it says this is the end of the document and now the finish conversation button can be clicked.  I looked back at the instructions too and saw that.  I think we are good and can click finish.  Thank you
same here. Thank you bhi. bye.,same here.  Thank you also.  bye

"Family  mein kutch chal raha hai kutch log hamare family mein ek poor teenager ko adopt kiye hain,phir use kon se coleege kon se sports mein dalna hai yehi sab chal raha hai.","It's got a few things going on - family (well-off folks adopt a poor teenager), sports (teen's a football star, how will he get into college?), and some social commentary about all of the above."
Oh yek ek true story par based hai.,"Oh, and it's based on a true story."

"voh offensice lineman hein, thoda big aur atheltic guy hein","He's an offensive lineman - a big, athletic guy."

"muje bhi, voh thoda wild hein, aap movie ko enjoy kiya?",I didn't either! That's wild. Did you enjoy the movie?

personally muje sports mein kuch interested nahi hein.. kaise heavily impact hota mera ability ko is movie ko watch karne se?,"It can be, but not always. I'm personally not that interested in Sports. How heavily does that impact my ability to watch it?"
"mein bhi super-into sports... lekin kuch ache movies bhi hota... michael, foster se bhag jaatha aur football ko offer kartha.. leigh anne ka friends tho usse adopt karthe lekinvoh veiled racism aur classism hote, voh apne talents se comfortable tha..","I hear you - I'm not super-into Sports, either. There's a lot more going on that makes it a good watch: Michael runs away from foster care + football offers a way for him to feel better about himself and life; Leigh Anne's friends question the safety of adopting him via thinly veiled racism and classism; there's a bit about him becoming comfortable with his talents. Sound any better? :)"
"Definitely, kuch better sound kartha.. mein suna hoon ki is movie mein kuch backlash, racial parts bhi hein... tho konsa part aapko uncomfortable huva?",That definitely makes it sound a little better. I heard there was some backlash about the racial parts of the movie. Do you think any part of the movie made you uncomfortable?

Aside from what I mentioned above (the mom's racist friends - whom she rebukes), I don't know about any other backlash. What did you hear?"
haan kuch loog tho offensive they... fir kon offensive they? aur kya aap is film mein enjoy kare?,"Just that some people found it offensive. Then again, who doesn't find things offensive? What else did you enjoy about the film?"
"haan yeh sach hein... kuch people ko pasand nahi tha kyon ki yeh white family, black boy ko help kar raha tha.. mein itna bhi sure nahi hoon, ki michaelko tutor mila jo outspoken aur ache thi, aur uska personality tho fun hein... voh happy thi usse football par love tha voh ache hein.. inspiring aur hopeful tha","That's true. Maybe some people didn't like that it was a white family helping a black boy? I'm not sure. I did like when they got Michael a tutor - she was outspoken and nice, so her personality added some fun to the goings-on. And seeing him become happier and feel loved while doing better at football was great...inspiring, hopeful, that sort of thing. "
aur kuch is movie ke baare mein aapko ache nahi lagi?,Is there anything that you didn't like about the movie?
"aise kuch nahi lekin kuch elements tho dekhne ke liye ache nahi lagtha.. for example, yek scene mein uska maa racist friends ne usse disturb kar rahe they jo realistic hei.. aur jab michael uska childhood ghar jaatha aur voh gang members usse violent karthe voh thoda stressful aur sad huva us michael ka future ko","Not dislike, per se, but there were elements that were harder to watch. For example, the scene w/ the mother's racist friends was disturbing - not least b/c it was so realistic. And when Michael goes back to his childhood home and his time with the gang members there turns violent, it's stressful and sad to think it might derail Michael's future."
"muje lagtha heinki voh reality ka situation ko ache se tackled kiya.. kahi racist elements ko dekhna tho muje uncomfortable huva, lekin yeh hi life hein.. muje hope heinki is movie ko kahi logon ko motivates hoga aur unka isses ko overcome karnenge... aapka fav scene kya hein?","It seems like they tackled the reality of the situation really well. It would make me uncomfortable to see the more racist elements, but that is a part of life. I hope the movie helps other people see the reasons to try and overcome issues. Do you have a favorite scene?"
"haan mein maantha hoon- yeh ache hein aur people ko kabhi uncomfortable nahi karthe, tho soch lo aur hopefully dekho ki kya wrong hein.. mera favorite scene hein jab michael, leigh anne ko question puchta aur usse motivate kartha.. voh tho important conversation hei, har koi nahi kar sakthe.. badi ultimately michael ne kaha-- aur uska aakri feeling thi is opinion ko","Yes, I agree - it's good to show it, and good to make people uncomfortable, so they think about it and hopefully see what's wrong. I think my favorite scene is when Michael questions Leigh Anne (mother) about her motives for taking him in. It was an important conversation to have, and not an easy one, but ultimately Michael's okay w/ what she says - and it shows that he's finally feeling safe enough to have opinions about things."
